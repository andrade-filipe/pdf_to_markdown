Could the 300-kilometer-long Hopi Lake have spilled\nover the Kaibab Upwarp to erode Grand Canyon?  A composite satellite image of a 25-square-kilometer tract from Coconino\nCounty adjacent to Buffalo Range Road in Wagon Box Draw displays terracelike landforms within the structural ramp of Kai­\nbab Formation.  Landforms are terraces expressed upon gentle slopes as low as 0.02 (rise over run 1:50) within the uppermost\nlimestone beds of the Harrisburg Member of the Kaibab Formation at elevation of ~1750 m (5740 ft).  A typical 20-meter-wide,\nsteplike terrace has a thin, centimeter-thick, light yellow-brown, porous carbonate encrustation we term “tufa.”  The transgres­\nsive Lake Bonneville depositional terrace model of Chen and Maloof (2017) is applied to the limestone dip slope at Wagon\nBox Draw.  As the wave-dominant shoreline rises over the dip slope, our model specifies how the terrace is first eroded into\nthin-bedded limestone and, later, is deposited with residual gravel.  Lastly, because of continued quick transgression, the shore­\nline depositional terrace is accreted with a thin crust of tufa.  We consider and dispute four alternates to our shoreline transgres­\nsive terrace model (landform outcrop pattern caused by level strata, spacing caused by bedrock joints, dunelike or boudinage\nstructural expression in limestone bed, and soil solifluction with gravity compaction).  We interpret these Wagon Box Draw\nshoreline terraces to have been carved within the limestone slope as Hopi Lake rose to fill Bidahochi Basin.  We believe that\nfilling of Bidahochi Basin was accelerated by breaching of another big lake upstream in Utah.  Top-down overflow of higher\nbasins promoted quick filling of Bidahochi Basin, initiated catastrophic spillover of Kaibab Upwarp, began rapid drainage of\nHopi Lake, and resulted in catastrophic erosion of Grand Canyon.\nABSTRACT\nKEYWORDS\nShoreline landforms, erosional terrace, depositional terrace, transgression, tufa, Hopi Lake, Bidahochi Basin, Lake Bonne­\nville, Grand Canyon.\n",

Rendered by Nate Loper as a 3D terrain model using Blender software and posted on 3D hosting\nplatform Sketchfab (Loper, 2022a).\nhave engendered their own legacy concerning spilling lakes.  During\nthe last 50 years the consensus creationist explanation has been that\nthe 300-kilometer-long Hopi Lake spilled over the Kaibab Upwarp\nto erode Grand Canyon (Austin et al., 2020).\nWhat was the elevation of the paleolake?  A likely elevation of the\npaleolake is 1860 meters (6100 feet) as recognized from tufa deposits\njust east of Grand Canyon and similar tufa near St. Johns, Arizona\n(Scarborough et al., 1998; Scarborough 2001; Austin et al., 2020).\nCurrent models of 1860-meter lake level assume post-lake tectonic\ntilting of Kaibab Plateau (Austin et al., 2020).  A higher elevation\nof the putative paleolake, without plateau tilting, was suggested by\nDouglass et al. (2020).\nThe Bidahochi Basin terrain model (Figure 1) depicts a stage in\nfilling when the paleolake was at elevation 1770 meters (5800 feet) as\nterraces formed at Wagon Box Draw.  We believe the lake continued\nto rise to ~1860 meters (~6100 feet).  Figure 1 shows the eastern\nGrand Canyon and Kaibab Upwarp in the upper left.  Eastward of\nGrand Canyon is Echo Cliffs Monocline crossing Marble Canyon at\nLees Ferry, Arizona.  On the horizon in the top middle of Figure 1 is\nthe upper Colorado River basin in Utah and Colorado.  In the upper\nright of Figure 1 is the Defiance Upwarp forming the highlands on\nthe eastern end of Bidahochi Basin.  Mogollon Rim is the highland\nin the foreground marking the southwestern edge of the Colorado\nPlateau.\nThrough the years three geologic evidences have been offered by\nspillover advocates indicating the Bidahochi Basin was a depression\nfilled by a lake.  First, sedimentary deposits in the upper half of the\nBidahochi Formation, along with an ecosystem of lake fossils, argue\nstrongly for the paleolake (Douglass et al. 2020).  Second, near\n1770 meters elevation, there is no tectonic confinement within the\nmiddle of Bidahochi Basin allowing western extension and filling\nwith water against the Kaibab Upwarp (Scarborough, 1989; Holm,\n2001; Dallegge et al. 2003; He and Kapp, 2021).  Third, widely\ndistributed shoreline tufa deposits above 1860 meters elevation\nmake the paleolake credible (Harris et al., 1998; Scarborough,\n2001; Austin et al, 2020).  A fourth geologic evidence for the lake\nmight be offered in terracelike landforms at the shore.  However, no\npublication yet concerns Hopi Lake shoreline terraces.  The present\nauthors here seek to explore this possible shoreline evidence.\nBefore proposing a search for shoreline terraces of Hopi Lake, we\nmust ask if our motives for such a search are geologically reasonable.\nSlopes along the shoreline of putative Hopi Lake just below 1860\nmeters (6100 feet) elevation are typically 0.02 (topographic “rise”\ndivided by horizontal “run,” sometimes depicted as 1:50).  Slope\nexpressed as 0.02 (rise over run) is equivalent to slope angle 1.1\ndegree (the arctangent of 0.02).  Ice Age Lake Bonneville has the\nmost intensely studied Pleistocene shorelines (Gilbert 1890, Chen\nand Maloof 2017, Oviatt 2020).  If the comparison of Ice Age\nLake Bonneville to Hopi Lake is proper, then shoreline terraces\nof ancient glacial Lake Bonneville should be evident on slopes of\n0.02 or less.  However, Lake Bonneville shorelines are typically\nfound on slopes averaging 0.1 (rise over run 1:10), equivalent to\n5.7 degrees.  We have been searching Bonneville slopes of 0.02\n(rise over run), equivalent to 1 degree for shoreline erosional\nterraces, but we have not found good examples.  The expression of\nformer Lake Bonneville shorelines on different slopes is perhaps\nbest illustrated at Brown Knoll, a volcanic lava-dome complex in\nthe southern basin of Lake Bonneville, Utah (lat./long., +38.722,\n-113.350).  Figure 2 is the oblique profile aerial photograph of the\nwestern dome at Brown Knoll that was completely transgressed by\nfilling to the highest level of Lake Bonneville.  Brown Knoll West\ndisplays excellent transgressive shoreline terraces on slopes of 0.1\n(6 degrees) near the base of the volcanic dome structure.  However,\nat slopes of 0.02 (1 degree) at the top of the western dome, shoreline\nterraces do not occur.  The same conclusion could be made about\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n347\n",

Early in our study we obtained low-altitude, oblique aerial\nmovie footage of this location we call “Nate’s Hill.”  Landform aerial\noverflight video was edited and posted so we could invite specialists\nto give us their opinions (Loper, 2022b).\nWe recognized a 25-square-kilometer area of interest (Figures\n6 and 7).  Figure 6 is the portion of the Anderson Canyon USGS\n1:24,000 scale topographic map.  Figure 7 is the published USGS\nFlagstaff 30’ x 60’ geological quadrangle map of Billingsley et al.\n(2013).  We used the map and report of Billingsley et al. (2013) as\nour introductory framework for bedrock structure and stratigraphy.\nWe greatly expanded our understanding of bedrock structure through\nfield study at the landform tract.\nNext, we assembled satellite imagery from Google Earth to form\na half-meter-resolution composite, vertical image collectively\ncomposed of about 100 million pixels.  Upon the composite, high-\nresolution image, we overlayed a two-meter contour interval map\nfrom the USGS digital elevation model (DEM).  The 25-square-\nkilometer composite landform tract image with overlain contour lines\nis rendered in lower resolution in Figure 8.  Our attention became\nfocused on 13 “landform fields” within Figure 8.  Those 13 “landform\nfields” are numbered in Figure 8, and we selected four fields for the\nmost detailed study.  Each of these four fields is depicted as an added\nfigure.  Figure 9 is field 2 which we call “Interstate Highway Arch.”\nFigure 10 is field 4 which we call “Chevron Hill.”   Figure 11 is field\n7 which we call “Nate’s Hill.”  Figure 12 is field 8 which we call\n“Graben Hill.”\nFinally, and most important for methodological discussion, we\nstudied the landforms in the field.  We observed the stratigraphy\nof the outcropping Harrisburg Member at the top of the Kaibab\nFormation, and related the landforms to the faults and folds that form\nthe bedrock ramp structure of the southern margin of the Colorado\nPlateau just north of the Mogollon Rim.\nOBSERVATIONS—STRUCTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY\nFigure 7 is the relevant portion of the geologic map of Billingsley\net al. (2013) showing the 25-square-kilometer research area.  It\ndisplays the limestone ramp of Kaibab Formation that descends from\nsouthwest to northeast, away from the Mogollon Rim and through\nthe landform tract.  The ramp dips northeastward with slope 0.01(rise\nover run 1:100) and primarily exposes the uppermost beds of the\nHarrisburg Member of the Kaibab Formation (light blue in Figure\n7).  Two secondary geologic structures occur on the ramp.  The first\nis gentle, northeast-trending, plunging anticlines and synclines.  The\nplunging anticline axis runs northward through “Interstate Highway\nArch” (field 2).   That feature has limestone strata dipping westward\non the west side of the hill and eastward on the east side of the hill.\nThe northern side of Wagon Box Draw is a consequence of a very\ngentle plunging syncline, and the limestone outcrop called “Nate’s\nHill” (field 7).  The north side of Wagon Box Draw at “Nate’s Hill”\nis the limestone northern limb (dip slope) of the gently plunging\nsyncline.  The slope of “Nate’s Hill” is 0.02 (rise over run 1:50) and\nis a two-component system (0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02) being composed of\nthe ramp’s slope (0.01) added to the anticline’s slope (0.01).  The\nsecond structure superimposed on the ramp is a suite of northwest-\ntrending graben structures expressed at northwest-trending listric\nnormal faults.  Strata of Moenkopi Formation (green in Figure 7)\nand Quaternary-Pliocene gravels (yellow in Figure 7) are frequently\ndepressed within these grabens.\nThe stratigraphy within the primary ramp is best displayed in\nFigure 13 just 3.7 kilometers northeast of the landform research\ntract (just off the northeast corner of Figure 7).  There deep erosion\nFigure 6. Portion of Anderson Canyon 1:24,000 USGS topographic map\nof the 25-square-kilometer Wagon Box Draw study area (large red square).\nThe contour interval is 20 feet.

These landforms occur just south of\nInterstate Highway 40 at the Buffalo Range Road exit (Arizona I-40,\nexit 225) about 45 kilometers east of Flagstaff, Arizona.  Figures\n3 and 4 show the geographic context of what we call “Wagon Box\nDraw Landform Tract.” The area of interest is 18 kilometers west-\nnorthwest of Meteor Crater, Arizona.  In this region, most land is\nadministrated by the Hopi, and the tract is used primarily as cattle\nrangeland.  We discovered, upon viewing satellite imagery, a complex\nof terracelike landforms at 1740 meters (5,700 feet) elevation in the\ndrainage called Wagon Box Draw, an example of which is shown in\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n350\n",

          "text_content": "within Diablo Canyon has exposed the full, 23-meter-thick strata\nsequence within the Harrisburg Member of the uppermost Kaibab\nFormation.  The Harrisburg Member is slope-forming brownish-gray\nto reddish-gray interbedded, thin-bedded limestone, sandstone, and\nsiltstone.  That Figure 13 displays the complete 23 meters thickness\nof the Harrisburg Member is confirmed in Diablo Canyon by contact\nwith the overlying Moenkopi Formation (reddish and brownish\nfriable siltstone, sandstone and mudstone) which usually weathers\nand crumbles markedly to form the ramp’s surface at the top of\nHarrisburg Member.  Also, within Diablo Canyon, is the cliff outcrop\nof the underlying Fossil Mountain Member of the Kaibab Formation\n(light-gray cherty, thick-bedded limestone that is extremely resistant\nto erosion).  Within and around the structural ramp of the Wagon Box\nDraw research tract, Billingsley et al. (2013) mapped several small\nerosional outliers of Moenkopi Formation sitting on Harrisburg\nMember.  Thus, we conclude that the ramp is expressed with the\nbeds of the upper Harrisburg Member.  We identified informally the\nuppermost six meters of Harrisburg Member in Figure 13 (slope\nforming, thin-bedded limestone, with thin bedded sandy and silty\nlimestone) as the “platform carbonate unit” that we regard as marker\nbeds that can be recognized widely on the ramp’s surface.  An\nexcellent exposure of these ramp limestone strata has been created\nby Interstate Highway roadbuilders who quarried surficial gravel\nfrom the rectangular borrow pit on the north side of Highway 40 at\n“Interstate Highway Arch” (Figure 9).  Here the landform terrace\nerosional surface and its overlying terrace deposit has been quarried.\nThat the dip slope of the “platform carbonate unit” is the bedrock host\nfor the linear, terracelike landforms on Nate’s Hill is demonstrated, we\nbelieve conclusively, by geometric analysis of oblique photography.\nFigure 14 is a compelling oblique image of Nate’s Hill looking\nwestward.  Linear landforms on the southern slope of Nate’s Hill are\nseen extending eastward to the scarp of the prominent listric normal\nfault where the limestone strata of the “platform carbonate unit” are\ndisplayed in the scarp beneath the linear landforms.  Obviously, the\nlandforms in Figure 14 are inscribed on the dip slope of limestone.\nIn the field we were impressed by the horizontality of the linear\nlandforms.  Through one-kilometer distance across Nate’s Hill we\nwere able to follow a linear landform ridge that appears to vary in\nelevation by less than one meter.  We observed this extraordinary\nhorizontality on Figure 11’s DEM overlay and on the outcrop in\nthe field using the level bubble on a Brunton compass.  Even more\nremarkable, however, is how the landforms deviate from horizontality\nat both east and west ends of Nate’s Hill.  Notice on Figure 11 how the\nlandforms turn down slope as the listric normal faults are approached\non both the east and west ends of Nate’s Hill.  These deviations from\nhorizontality, we believe, are caused by drag on the faults.  Figure 12\neven shows the effect of fault drag on the landforms on the opposite\nside of the large graben at what we call Graben Hill.  Overall, the\nBuffalo Range Road graben offsets landforms vertically by 15\nmeters, down on the eastern side.  These observations of deviations\nfrom horizontality persuade us, by their cross-cutting relationship,\nthat nearly level terracelike landforms on the dip slope are older than\nthe normal faults that produced the graben.  Thus, we understand the\nBidahochi Basin has been deepened tectonically by listric faulting\nsince the time that Hopi Lake formed.\nOBSERVATIONS—OVERALL APPEARANCE OF\nLANDFORMS\nLandforms were studied in the field to obtain a better appreciation\nof relationships to bedrock stratigraphy and structure.  Oblique\naerial video (Loper, 2022b) shows linear landforms on Nate’s Hill\nthat typically light-brown ridges of rock separate darker brown\ndepressions with sandy soil and xerophytic plants.   Of the rangeland\nplants, bushes on the flats are the most visible from the aerial video.\nBushes typically are half-meter diameter, so that scale indicates that\nlight-brown ridges of rock are typically spaced 20 (+/- 5) meters.\nWhen walking in the upslope direction across the sandy low areas,\none first encounters the linear rocky ridge with a noteworthy steeper,\ninclined rocky surface element that we call the “face” of the landform.\nSometimes the “face” shows evidence of concave upward curvature\nand the strike the limestone.  Upslope from the “face” is a convex\nrock surface with the highpoint being the crest of the landform.  We\ncall this convex rock surface the “berm” of the landform.  In the\nupslope direction, the “berm” passes into the adjacent “flat” usually\nexpressed as gravel or sand.  The overall height of the sloping “face”\nand the upslope convex “berm” is typically 0.4 (+/- 0.2) meter.  The\nwidth of the rocky mound over the ground surface is usually less than\n5 meters. These rocky mounds do not display soil and, therefore,\nFigure 14. Oblique aerial view of Nate’s Hill looking west over the fault\nscarp.  Terrace landforms typically have 20-meter spacing.  This oblique\nview, we believe, makes a compelling case for the successive terraces being\ninscribed on the dip slope exposing a single, thinner limestone bed at the top\nof the Harrisburg Member.  This view disputes the notion that the successive\nlandforms on the slope are outcrop expressions of a series of thinner lime­\nstone beds.\nFigure 15. Chevron Hill displays the Harrisburg Member outcrop ridge\n(berm and face) landform that divides two flat terrace landforms.  The entire\nlimestone outcrop is encrusted with thinly laminated, cool-water carbonate\n(“tufa”).  We saw (1) abundant bladelike limestone clasts, (2) positioning of\nbladelike clasts on the downslope side of an outcropping bedrock ridge, and\n(3) encrustation with calcareous tufa.  We noted the similarity to Lake Bon­\nneville tufa and Lake Bonneville transgressive shoreline terraces (Chen and\nMaloof 2017) and we asked, “Is this a beach deposit?”\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n354\n",

Contrast this with soil-covered surface of\nthe “flat” that has darker color and distinctive texture caused by\nbushes and aeolian volcanic deposition.  These contrasting colors\nand textures accentuate the linearity of landforms seen, especially, in\nthe oblique fly-over in the aerial video (Loper, 2022b).  Slopes are\npoorly appreciated on aerial video because video hardly ever shows\nthe horizon.  Field observations allow us to state that landforms are\nexpressed upon gentle slopes of 0.02 to 0.08 (rise over run 1:50 to\n1:12).\nBefore addressing details in the different elements of these\nlandforms, we must recognize and describe the carbonate coating\nthat frequently covers Harrisburg Member limestone, especially\nnear the tops of hills.  The carbonate-rock coating is widespread\nwith the landforms, but it is not universal.  Figures 15 to 18 help\ncharacterize this carbonate coating.  Figure 15 shows the widespread\ndistribution of the carbonate-encrusted Harrisburg Member near the\ntop of Chevron Hill.  The limestone exposure is almost completely\nencrusted with yellowish-brown, spongy carbonate.  As is typical of\nthese outcrops, the coating conforms to angular and broken corners\nof limestone boulders and cobbles.  Figure 16 shows a larger cobble\nencrusted with typical, yellowish-brown, spongy carbonate. The\nyellowish-brown coating in Figure 16 is thin where the surface of\nthe cobble is broken exposing gray Harrisburg Limestone that is the\nsubstrate for the coating.  The background in Figure 16 accentuates\nthe story: the cobble was moved from the rocky ridge to the adjacent\nflat to contrast its color with the darker, reddish-brown soil in the flat.\nFigure 17 displays a typical cross-sectional view of the encrusting\ncoating which possesses pillarlike botryoidal columns and faintly\nlaminated structure within an open spongy texture.  Figure 17\nshows the encrustation in its common 2 centimeters thickness.  We\nexamined the encrustation with hand lens and microscope.  Figure 18\nshows the encrustation by a “flashlight microscope” inserted into the\nopen spongy texture.  Figure 18 displays the encrustation dominated\nby silt-size calcite crystals that express botryoidal masses that have\ngrown into a hole between pillars.\nWhat name should we assign to this laminated carbonate encrusting\nrock?  One can visualize calcite crystals being precipitated while\nimmersed in fresh water, at Earth’s normal surface temperature,\nbeneath an alkaline organic slime layer that temporarily covered\nthe rock surface (Ford and Pedley, 1996; Pedley et al., 2008).  Our\nvisualized calcite precipitation process differs markedly from\nthe present desert slope, near the top of a dry hill, where we find\nthe carbonate encrustation today!  The encrustation is surficial,\nnot associated with joints or faulting.  No evidence was found for\nhydrothermal process.  The encrustation does not compel us to\nimagine a thermal spring deposit (travertine) as we have studied\nat Yellowstone.  Furthermore, this surficial feature is unlike a cave\ndeposit (speleothem).  The spongy encrustation reminds us of the\nrock called “tufa” that we have seen along the high shoreline of Ice\nAge Lake Bonneville (Hart et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2005; Felton\net al., 2006).  We have found the rock we call calcareous tufa to be\nFigure 16. Gray, very hard, Harrisburg Limestone cobble is thinly encrusted\nwith friable, laminated, yellow-brown, porous tufa.\nFigure 17. Cross-sectional view of the encrusted Harrisburg Limestone sur­\nface.  Tufa shows internal lamination parallel to the limestone surface and\ndisplays internally pillarlike calcite structures with abundant porosity.\nFigure 18. Flashlight microscope view of encrustation on limestone surface.\nThe open structure of pillars, with abundant holes between, displays botryoi­\ndal masses composed of silt-size calcite bound together by microcrystalline\ncalcite.  These types of carbonate structures form in modern shallow lake\nshorelines, at normal surface temperature, where microbial films coat sur­\nfaces creating a sticky and alkaline microenvironment, inducing trapping of\nsilt-size particles, and cementation with microcrystalline calcite.  This thin\nencrustation, we propose, should be called tufa.\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n355\n",

It resembles the Bonneville “capping\ntufa” of Felton et al. (2006).\nOBSERVATIONS—LANDFORMS IN DETAIL\nAs we already have described, Wagon Box Draw landforms are linear\nand ridgelike being composed of three elements: “berm,” “face”\nand “flat.”  The berm contains the crest line of exposed limestone\nthat is the high point of the structure with the line of the berm crest\nexpressing nearly horizontal orientation.  It is a convex-upward,\nsubtle ridgelike landform.  Beneath the widespread yellow-brown\nencrustation of calcareous tufa, the berm is composed of resistant\ngray limestone of the upper Harrisburg Member.  Where bedrock\nlimestone is exposed within the berm, it is sometimes evident that\nstrike and dip of the limestone is approximately concordant with the\noverall slope.  The surface of the berm is often strewn with platy or\nbladelike clasts of Harrisburg Member limestone with a deficiency\nof rollable, spindlelike limestone clasts.  The concentration of platy\nclasts, together with the presence of tufa, remind us of shorelines\nterraces we have inspected at Lake Bonneville and Salt Lake in Utah\nand at Salton Sea in California.\nThe face is the most steeply dipping landform surface within the\nWagon Box Draw landform field.  The face is the dipping plucked\nlimestone surface always just downslope of the berm.  In other places\nthe flat is loose gravel without tufa coating.  Often, especially where\ntufa encrustation is missing, the face appears to be an erosional scarp\nwhere the strike of the scarp surface approximately parallels the\nstrike of the Harrisburg Member limestone bedding.  As one looks\ndown the strike of the erosional scarp, that scarp appears to be the\nuppermost part of a concave-upward surface that is mostly buried by\nthe adjacent flat.  From this viewing angle, one can appreciate that\nthe face is exposing information on the strike and dip of Harrisburg\nMember limestone strata.  This viewing angle sometimes allows one\nto appreciate that the landform is inscribed laterally by erosion on the\ndip slope of the bedrock beneath.\nAn unusual viewpoint effect occurs when one stands on the face\nof the landform and looks directly downslope.  The face of the\nnext landform downslope is invisible, because its exposed surface\nis directed downslope.  What one sees looking downslope is the\nnext berm (which conceals the next face below) whose topography\nappears indistinct because that berm is being observed from a low\nangle from above.  Therefore, the downslope viewpoint shows\njust sediment-filled terraces with rather indistinct berms whose\ntopography is not accentuated.  Color contrast is the most noteworthy\ndownslope property.  That viewpoint effect can be contrasted with\nFigure 19. Field view of steplike terraces near the top of Chevron Hill.  Landform terminology is applied.  The slope is almost completely coated with thin,\nyellow-brown tufa encrustation.\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n356\n",

That gravel\nfill is likely a significant volume of the flat as can be seen from the\nborrow-pit excavation of the flat by Interstate Highway construction\nengineers (Figure 9).\nTypical spacing between berms is 20 m (+/- 5) over the ground.\nHeight of the landform between adjacent berms averages 0.4 (+/-\n0.2) meter.  Figure 19 is a typical view of landforms occurring\nin steplike terraces ascending the limestone slope.  These three\nlandform elements can be deflected by topographic irregularities as\nif a shoreline of a lake rose over the curved surface of limestone\nforming coves and points.\nINTERPRETATION -- DIP SLOPE DEPOSITIONAL\nTERRACE MODEL\nThe word “shoreline” can be defined as a narrow erosional and\ndepositional zone formed where the earth’s exposed surface meets a\nbody of water.  The terrace, composed of a front slope (the “riser”) and\na flatter elongate step (the “tread”), is the familiar shoreline landform\n(Bates and Jackson, 1984).  Shorelines can be described as belonging\nto one of two types dominated by either erosion or deposition.  Most\nfamiliar are high relief erosional shorelines that make classic impact\non human perception.  There are also less impressive low relief\ndepositional shorelines.  Further characterization recognizes the\ntime sequence of shoreline landforms produced whether regression\nor transgression.  Thus, shorelines can be classified into four types\n(inspired by Helland-Hansen and Martinsen, 1996):\n1.\nHigh-relief erosional shorelines.\na.\nRegressive erosional terrace.\nb.\nTransgressive erosional terrace.\n2.\nLow-relief depositional shorelines.\na.\nRegressive depositional terrace.\nb.\nTransgressive depositional terrace.\nFigure 20. The “transgressive depositional terrace” model for Hopi Lake shoreline landforms.  The high Lake Bonneville shoreline model of Chen and\nMaloof (2017) is applied to the Wagon Box Draw terraces of Hopi Lake.  Here we depict two successive terraces have been inscribed by rising water on a\nlimestone dip slope possessing resistant and friable beds.  These two terraces are about 40 meters wide through the slope but only 0.5 meter high.  Shorelines\nS-1, S-2, S-3, and S-4 mark succeeding water levels during the rapid lake transgression over the limestone slope.  Transgression causes milling of the lime­\nstone surface and leaves behind subsequent erosional and depositional landforms.

          "text_content": "Among the geomorphologists who have so marvelously documented\nthe highest shorelines of Lake Bonneville during the last 130\nyears, the consensus is that these highest Bonneville shorelines\nare “transgressive depositional terraces” (Chen and Maloof, 2017;\nOviatt and Jewell, 2016).  These most intensively studied Bonneville\nterraces are typically imprinted on slopes of 0.1 (rise over run 1:10),\nbut we are unaware of reported examples for slopes of 0.02 (rise over\nrun 1:50).  These high Bonneville shorelines are widely recognized\nto be transgressive because they culminate with the highest shoreline\nand the catastrophic flood and rapid regression of the lake by over\n100 meters.\nFigure 20 is our adaptation of the “transgressive depositional\nterrace” model of Chen and Maloof (2017) to the lower slopes of\nHopi Lake within Bidahochi Basin.  Observations of Bonneville high\nshorelines allowed Chen and Maloof (2017) to derive their model of\na “transgressive depositional terrace” assuming a steep and steady\nslope over uniform bedrock.  Our adaptation of their model assumes\na low-sloping surface with a dip slope having alternating resistant\nand friable beds of thin-bedded Harrisburg Limestone.  Chen and\nMaloof need little vertical exaggeration in their Bonneville terrace\nmodel.  We used “extreme vertical exaggeration” of at least 25\ntimes vertical in Figure 20 to display the Hopi shoreline terrace on a\nperspective block diagram.\nWater waves are widely appreciated to have declining water velocity\n(and shear stress on bedrock surfaces) with increasing depth.\nRecreational snorkel divers and SCUBA divers are experienced with\nthis fact.  Declining velocity with depth is caused by the circular\nmotion of molecules within the water surface wave that die out with\ndepth.  Figure 20 (upper right) displays our model of the velocity-\ndepth profile as water waves impact the shore parallel to the limestone\ndip slope.\nFigure 20 shows the initial lake shoreline level (S-1) where shallow\nwater waves with higher velocity and shear stress have already begun\nto bevel a new surface called the “terrace erosional platform” into\nthe “resistant” limestone dip slope.  The down-slope side of “terrace\nerosional platform” begins to accumulate coarse gravel in the lower\nright as the platform continues to be eroded by waves.  The erosion\nprocess occurs fastest at the “notch” on the growing platform as the\n“friable” limestone bed within the dip slope is intersected.  Even\nthough the water becomes deeper with time, the erosional terrace\ncontinues to extend shoreward forming the “notch” into the dip slope\nwith erosion of the underlying “friable” limestone bed.\nIn Figure 20 at lake level S-2, the level of the lake has risen enough\nto reach a critical system threshold.  At the increased water depth\nat the “notch,” there is no longer enough shear stress to erode the\n“resistant” limestone underlying the “friable” layer.  Therefore, the\n“erosional platform” stops being eroded, and the erosive power of\nwaves is expended on the “erosional scarp” above the “notch.”  That\n“erosional scarp” is a concave-upward surface where water waves\npluck the limestone substrate.  The debris plucked is accumulated\ndownslope of the “inflection line” where a convex-upward mound of\ncoarse gravel builds up.  The threshold at lake level S-2 causes the\nexcavated “erosional platform” (sculpted at S-1) to be overlain by\nthe “gravel-covered platform” (deposited at S-2).\nIn Figure 20 after lake level S-2, the lake continues to rise even more\nreaching another critical system threshold.  At S-3 there is no longer\nenough shear stress within the deeper water to pluck limestone\nfrom the “erosional scarp.”  Instead, deeper water allows gravel to\nbe deposited over the “notch” and “erosional scarp.”  The newer,\nelevated water level at S-3 is, again, on the upper surface of the\n“resistant” limestone dip slope.  The erosive power of shallow waves\nis, again, able to start forming another “erosional platform.”  This\nprocess initiates the formation of the next “transgressive depositional\nterrace.”  While the second depositional terrace is forming, the first\ndepositional terrace’s erosional scarp receives silt and sand which\nfills most of the concavity.  Then, on shallow, quiet, sunlit, cool, off-\nshore beveled limestone when the lake level has risen above S-4,\nlacustrine microbial carbonate encrustation form “tufa.”  The second\ndepositional terrace block diagram (top of Figure 20) displays the\nstructure after Hopi Lake has drained and after soil has occupied the\nnew landform.  The final condition of the terrace landform (top of\nFigure 20) shows the “berm,” “face,” and “flat” as we describe them\nin the field.\nDISCUSSION\nWe interpret these Wagon Box Draw landforms to be old shoreline\ndepositional terraces carved within the limestone dip slope as\nHopi Lake rose to fill Bidahochi Basin.  Could other explanations\nbe offered instead of shoreline erosion and deposition on terraces?\nHere we note four processes that could be alternates to shoreline\nerosion and we respond briefly.  The four alternate processes are: (1)\npattern from multiple flat-lying strata eroding differentially within\nthe slope, (2) pattern from erosion of strata that possess strong joint\nexpression, (3) pattern from erosion of hummocky bedforms, dunes\nor boudinage within the Harrisburg Limestone, and (4) pattern of\nterrace-like steps caused by surficial gravity deformation through soil\ncreep or solifluction.  A compelling case can be made that Nate’s Hill\nis a dip slope, not an outcrop erosion pattern of numerous, level and\nsuccessive strata (see Figure 14).  The dip slope is expressing just a\nfew strata at its surface, not multiple successive strata.  Landforms on\nthe dip slope are not controlled by vertical limestone joints, because\nlandform alignments deviate greatly from steady northwestward joint\norientation on and around Nate’s Hill.  Could hummocky, dunelike\nor boudinage bedding structure within the limestone cause regularly\nspaced ridges (resembling terraces) to be expressed on the dip slope?\nWe have not found hummocks in the uppermost Harrisburg Member\nwith 20-meter spacing.  Figure 13 shows remarkable planar beds,\nnot hummocks, within the upper Harrisburg.  Reflect upon the\nimprobability that crests of ancient limestone hummocks, dunes or\nboudins would follow present topographic contour.   Coarse gravel\ndeposits on bedrock terraces would hardly be regarded as susceptible\nto soil creep and solifluction.\nRemarkably, linear landforms strongly parallel the 2-meter\ntopographic contour overlay except where the limestone is deformed\nby drag adjacent to faults.  We observed a berm structure that could\nbe traced one kilometer along the limestone dip slope of Nate’s Hill,\nyet the berm’s elevation appears to vary by less than a meter.  The\nlimestone dip slope at Nate’s Hill is terminated on its northeastern\nedge by the graben structure hosting Buffalo Range Road, with the\nassociated landforms northeast of the graben having 15-meter lower\nelevation compared to the southwestern side.  Thus, these landforms\ncorrespond marvelously with the bedrock structural geology and dip\nslope stratigraphy.  These observations support shoreline terraces.\nCritics of Hopi Lake often ask why shorelines have not been found at\nHopi Lake.  Michael Oard (2010, 2016, 2021) described successions\nof erosional benches that he understands to be shoreline terraces\nassociated with steep slopes adjacent to glacial Lake Bonneville.\nOard shows transgressive shoreline terraces for Lake Bonneville’s\nhighstand in Utah.  These glacial lake terraces are imprinted on slopes\nsteeper than 0.1 (rise over run steeper than 1:10).  The Bonneville\nexample of Oard include transgressive shoreline terraces as defined\nby Chen and Maloof (2017) along the tectonically active Wasatch\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n358\n",

Oard\nfrequently makes the comparison of Lake Bonneville with Hopi\nLake, saying that Hopi Lake has “no evidence for the lakes,” “no\nlake-bottom sediments,” “no tufa” and “no shorelines” (Oard 2010,\n2016, 2021).  Similarly, Tim Clarey dismisses Hopi Lake which he\nregards as one of those “fictional lakes that some creation geologists\npropose emptied in a catastrophic manner to carve Grand Canyon\nbut are based on little if any geological evidence” (Clarey 2018).\nThe way that Hopi Lake critics argue seems to imply that they are\nextremely familiar with Bidahochi Basin landforms.  That allows\nthem to toss out freely universal negatives, statements we believe are\nunworthy of good science publications.\nMichael Oard (2021) makes a lengthy argument claiming “no tufa”\nat Hopi Lake as described in Austin et al. (2020).  Oard discusses\ntufa, travertine and speleothems, then concludes, “So, tufa, or the\ninterpretation of tufa, is not necessarily a positive indicator of a\nshoreline.…” (Oard, 2021, p. 217).  Algal-secreted, laminated,\ncool-water carbonate coatings (“tufa”) are a very prominent feature\nalong the high shorelines of Lake Bonneville (Felton et al., 2006;\nVennin et al., 2018).  Because Oard believes in shorelines of\nPleistocene Lake Bonneville and modern Great Salt Lake, he should\ntell us why Bonneville and Salt Lake tufa “…is not necessarily a\npositive indicator of a shoreline” at these lakes.  Notice, Oard\ncan elaborately convolute the definition of “tufa,” but we have in\nmodern times witnessed deposition of an analogous cool-water,\ncalcareous encrustation at the shore of the modern Great Salt Lake!\nJust because terminology can be controversial, that does not require\ninterpretations to be (Cappezzuoli et al., 2013).\nWhat was the final volume of the paleolake?  If the basin structure\nthat impounded the lake is older than the lake, then Bidahochi Basin’s\nstructure can be used to estimate the volume of the 300-kilometer-\nlong paleolake.  Because tufa deposits indicate that the final filling\nof Bidahochi Basin was to present elevation of 1860 meters (6100\nfeet), the present topographic depression could have filled with\napproximately 4700 cubic kilometers (1130 cubic miles) of water.\nWe estimated paleolake volume from topographic cross-sections of\nthe basin.  However, our topographic-basin estimate of Hopi Lake\nis almost certainly an underestimate as illustrated by better-studied\nPleistocene Lake Bonneville in the Great Basin of Utah, Nevada and\nIdaho.  O’Connor (1993, 2016) estimated the volume of the Lake\nBonneville Flood into the Snake River to be 4750 cubic kilometers\nfrom analysis of Great Basin topography.  O’Connor (1993) assumed,\nFigure 21. Map of putative lakes associated with erosion of eastern Grand Canyon (from Austin et al., 2020).  Lakes on southern Colorado Plateau are\nunderstood to be successive and temporary, not simultaneous and enduring.  Upstream basins initiated the fill-and-spill process.  Canyonlands Lake formed\nfirst, then failed by spillover at Lees Ferry into Bidahochi Basin that was vacant of a big lake.  Hopi Lake rose rapidly and overtopped East Kaibab Mono­\ncline.  Then, rapid drainage of Hopi Lake caused Lake Toroweap to fill abruptly and breach Uinkaret Plateau at Toroweap.  After drainage of lakes and\nerosion of canyons, plateaus and basin continued to be tilted, down on the north side, up on the south side.\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n359\n",

          "text_content": "as G. K. Gilbert (1890), that Lake Bonneville drained catastrophically\nand lost 105 meters depth of water through spillover erosion at Red\nRock Pass, Idaho.  However, as shown by Adams and Bills (2016),\nLake Bonneville basin’s interior topography has been significantly\nelevated by post-lake isostatic rebound.  Adams and Bills (2016, p.\n160) revise O’Connor’s volume estimate of the Lake Bonneville\nFlood significantly upward to 5135 cubic kilometers.  Because Hopi\nLake was deeper than Lake Bonneville, the isostatic rebound effect\nwould be enhanced in the case of Hopi Lake.  Therefore, we estimate,\nconservatively, Hopi Lake’s volume to be 5200 cubic kilometers\n(1250 cubic miles).\nOur assumption of complete drainage of Hopi Lake makes the\nHopi Lake Flood (5200 cubic kilometers) slightly larger than the\nLake Bonneville Flood (5135 cubic kilometers).  The largest Lake\nMissoula Flood, from the Ice Age constriction of Clark Fork River\nin Montana, has been estimated at 2500 cubic kilometers (600 cubic\nmiles) by O’Connor et al. (2021).  Thus, the Hopi Lake Flood was\nslightly larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood, and more than twice\nthe size of the biggest Lake Missoula Flood.  These lakes and their\nerosive floods can be compared to modern Lake Michigan (4900\ncubic kilometers).\nA very big question that needs to be discussed is the relationship of\nBidahochi Basin and its Hopi Lake to upstream Utah and Colorado\nbasins and their possible ancient lakes.  Conventional, twentieth\ncentury geomorphic dogma since the time of William Morris Davis\nhas asserted that streams erode upstream from lowland plains\ntoward highland plateaus (Hilgendorf et al., 2020).  That historically\ndominant viewpoint has been called “headward erosion” and has\nprofoundly impacted geologist’s thinking about Grand Canyon\nerosion.  An alternate interpretation is that highland basins quickly\nfill with sediment and water as topographic barriers overflow or\nspillover.  This new model has revitalized John Newberry’s oldest\n1858 thinking about Grand Canyon and promoted top-down , not\nbottom-up, drainage basin integration.  Therefore, Bidahochi Basin\nand the putative Hopi Lake can be critical elements in Grand Canyon\nthinking.\nAlso, of critical importance in the top-down spillover discussion, is\nwhether any lakes upstream of Hopi Lake broke their topographic\nbarriers and filled Hopi Lake before it broke the Kaibab Plateau\nbarrier to erode Grand Canyon.  Figure 21 depicts the configuration\nof lakes, including a big lake in Utah.  Edmond Holroyd, employed\nfor many years as a Bureau of Reclamation scientist, was one of the\nearliest to rediscover the power of “top-down” thinking.  In 1986\nwhen living in Colorado next to Black Canyon of the Gunnison\nRiver, Holroyd discussed the Gunnison River drainage question with\nthe resident USGS geologist Dr. Wally Hansen, one of the architects\nof the headward erosion hypothesis (Austin et al., 2020).  During\nthe discussion with Hansen about Black Canyon, Holroyd adopted\ntop-down thinking that Black Canyon was excavated by spillover\ndrainage of a high lake.  Holroyd postulated other lakes downstream\nof Gunnison.  Late in 1986 he used a government DEM to plot “big\nlakes” which could form on modern Colorado Plateau landscape if\nGrand Canyon was blocked at the 5,700-foot elevation (Austin et al.,\n2020).  The computer chart made from the DEM allowed Holroyd to\npostulate a “big Utah lake” (Holroyd, 1987; Holroyd, 1988; Holroyd,\n1990; Holroyd, 1994).  Field work in July 1987 allowed Holroyd to\nrecognize that the big Utah lake breached its bedrock dam at Lees\nFerry and drained catastrophically to erode Marble Canyon.  That big\nUtah lake was later called Canyonlands Lake (Austin, 1994).  Then,\na priority dispute occurred about who first proposed “the big Utah\nlake” and its breaching at Lees Ferry to form Marble Canyon.  Walter\nBrown (2008) asserted, we believe incorrectly, that he had priority\nafter field work in summer 1988 and public presentations later in\n1988.  Brown published a lake map in 1989 (Brown, 1989).  However,\nHolroyd appears to have priority over Brown because Holroyd’s lake\nmap was circulated in 1987 and his written proposal (Holroyd, 1988)\ndescribing Lees Ferry breaching and Marble Canyon erosion was\ncirculated in January 1988 (see Austin et al., 2020).\nWas there a precursor to Hopi Lake within the Bidahochi Basin?\nSedimentary evidence in the lower Bidahochi Formation indicates\nthat the basin was vacant of a deep lake (Austin et al., 2020; Douglass\net al., 2020).  Good evidence of Hopi Lake being very deep (~1860\nmeters elevation) is first found in the upper Bidahochi Formation.\nThat evidence is the green, gastropod-bearing, fresh water clays of\nthe upper Bidahochi Formation.\nDid Canyonlands Lake fail at Lees Ferry creating an abrupt addition\nof water to Bidahochi Basin quickly raising the level of Hopi Lake?\nThat explanation would be in accord with the top-down perspective\nthat has become consensus spillover thinking (Blackwelder, 1934;\nMeek, 2019; Helgendorf et al., 2020; Larson et al., 2022).  Geological\nevidence of rapid filling of Hopi Lake is evident at the transgressive\nshoreline terraces at Wagon Box Draw Landform Tract.  There the\ntufa is a very thin encrustation indicating that the lake did not endure\nat high level for a long time.  Thus, we regard the transgressive\nshoreline depositional terraces at Wagon Box Draw to be evidence\nfor rapid basin filling and abrupt disappearance of Hopi Lake.  After\nCanyonlands Lake failed at Lees Ferry, the new basin configuration\ncould allow the final filling of Hopi Lake to extend northward to\nColorado.  Therefore, an enormous temporary lake (much larger than\n5200 cubic kilometers) could have resided directly east of Kaibab\nPlateau, and could have been ready to overtop Kaibab Plateau\nbarrier, and erode Grand Canyon.  We have not seen a regressive\nsequence of shoreline terraces for Hopi Lake that would be evidence\nfor slow disappearance of Hopi Lake.  Because we have not seen\nsuch a regressive shoreline sequence, we assume that highstanding\nHopi Lake disappeared from its basin rapidly.  That implies lake\ndrainage by catastrophic spillover erosion.  The same can be said for\nhighstanding Lake Bonneville, that also lacks regressive shoreline\nterraces (Chen and Maloof, 2017; Oviatt, 2020).  The catastrophic\nfailure of Lake Bonneville’s dam at Red Rocks Pass in Idaho\nproduced the enormous flood on the Snake River Plain (O’Connor\net al., 2021).\nCONCLUSION\nWe interpret these tufa-encrusted landforms at Wagon Box Draw\nto be transgressive shoreline terraces carved within the Kaibab\nLimestone slope as Hopi Lake rose quickly to fill Bidahochi Basin.\nThese shoreline landforms indicate a basin-filling, deep lake.  We\npoint to several similarities with the high shoreline terraces of Lake\nBonneville.  Using the consensus model for high shorelines of Lake\nBonneville, our model specifies how the terrace is first eroded into\nthin-bedded limestone and then is later deposited with residual\ngravel.  Our model specifies an erosional platform and landward\nerosional scarp are inscribed, and then, because of transgression,\nthe platform and scarp are buried by residual coarse gravel.  Finally,\nbecause of continued quick transgression, the shoreline depositional\nterrace is accreted with a thin crust of tufa.  We believe that filling of\nBidahochi Basin was accelerated by breaching of Canyonlands Lake\nupstream in Utah.  Top-down overflow of higher basins promoted\nquick filling of Hopi Lake, initiated catastrophic spillover erosion of\nGrand Canyon, and caused rapid drainage of Hopi Lake.\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n360\n",

Austin has Ph.D. degree in sedimentary geology from\nPennsylvania State University. He serves as adjunct faculty at\nCedarville University and researches special projects with Logos\nResearch Associates. He has specialized in modeling catastrophic\nsedimentary process with specific application to strata of Grand\nCanyon. His 36-year investigation of a single fossil-bearing stratum\nwithin the Redwall Limestone has allowed him to camp two years\nbelow the rim of Grand Canyon. He is author of three books and\nmore than a hundred technical geology papers. His wife is Dr. Kelly\nA. Austin, professor of pediatric surgery at Children’s Hospital,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh.\nEdmond W. Holroyd, III earned his Ph.D. degree in atmospheric\nscience from State University of New York. He specialized in cloud\nphysics and weather modification working 31 years for the U.S.\nBureau of Reclamation. Specialization in remote sensing allowed\nhim to publish many technical science papers. He teaches adjunct at\nhigh schools and universities, and does volunteer work.\nThomas F. Folks is a retired U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of\nLand Management Wilderness/Outdoor Recreation Planner who has\nlived, worked, and explored the lands north of Grand Canyon for over\n50 years.  He continues to make use of his regional knowledge and\nextensive experience in aerial photography interpretation, mapping,\nland use planning, government permitting and resource management\nto assist a number of scientists in planning and executing research\nfield operations in the region.\nNate Loper is the Executive Director of Canyon Ministries and\nhas spent nearly 1,000 days teaching at the Grand Canyon and\nthroughout the Southwest, including leading dozens of river trips on\nthe Colorado River.  His background includes leading tours through\nnational parks and museums and speaking at conferences and events\nthroughout the US and UK on geology and biblical archaeology.  A\nformer pastor for many years, he is currently working on a master’s\ndegree in Ancient Civilizations and Egyptology.\nAUSTIN, HOLROYD, FOLKS, AND LOPER Shoreline Transgressive Terraces 2023 ICC\n362\n",

The pattern of NLSSS values qualitatively defines five biostratigraphic zones: the Precambrian through\nCambrian (with zero to low NLSSS values), the Ordovician through Mississippian (with low to moderate NLSSS values), the\nPennsylvanian through Permian (with very high NLSSS values), the Mesozoic (with low to high NLSSS values), and the Ce­\nnozoic (with moderate to very high NLSSS values).\nAs a criterion for identifying the pre-Flood/Flood boundary, NLSSS values strongly suggest a position below the Ordovician.\nAs a criterion for identifying the Flood/post-Flood boundary, NLSSS values strongly argue against a position very much above\nthe Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary is suggested by terrestrial NLSSS values in North\nAmerica, but a definitive global argument must await re-evaluation of global terrestrial vs. marine NLSSS data. Tentatively\nthen, the bottom and top NLSSS biostratigraphic zones are designated pre-Flood and post-Flood, respectively. The middle three\nNLSSS biostratigraphic zones—tentatively interpreted as Flood sediments—are provisionally identified as the burial of domi­\nnantly marine, coastline, and terrestrial organisms, respectively.\nThe large—and possibly periodic—variations in NLSSS values suggest that further mining of paleontological data may reveal\ninteresting biogeographical and/or depositional processes during pre-Flood, Flood, and post-Flood times. Lack of correlation\nbetween NLSSS pattern and stage-through-system-level biostratigraphic zones suggests that index fossils and sub-erathem\nstratigraphic units provide no more information about earth history than a relative time scale. Lack of NLSSS/megasequence\ncorrelations also suggests that surges in Flood energy were largely independent of the depositional pattern of fossils.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION\nFossils—as evidence of organisms living in the past—played an\nimportant part in diluvial theory, even before the rise of modern\ncreationism (see, e.g., Nelson 1931). Fossils were also important\nin many of the publications of early twentieth century creationists\nlike George McCready Price (see, e.g., Wise 2018), and they are re­\nferred to throughout the seminal creationist work, The Genesis Flood\n(Whitcomb and Morris 1961). Since then, there is scarcely an issue\nof any creationist journal that does not have at least one article refer­\nring to fossils.\nCreationism also has an interest in global patterns (such as those pat­\nterns that might identify and characterize the global Flood). Yet, in\nspite of the importance of fossils, and the emphasis in global pat­\nterns, creationists have made little use of the Paleobiology Database\n(PBDB). The PBDB is a repository of data on fossils from all global­\nly defined stratigraphic levels, and from localities all over the world.\nAlthough the PBDB is still in development, it already contains data\nfrom millions of fossils from all over the world. We agree with Ross’s\n(2012, 2013, 2014a, 2014b) arguments for the reliability of PBDB\ndata. We would like to encourage the use and mining of PBDB data\nby creationists by offering one example of the use of PBDB data in\nthe development of creationist Flood models.\nIn particular, we would like to use the PBDB to examine the per­\nsistence of biological form through the stratigraphic record—what\nwe call biostratigraphic continuity. Scientists have used various\nforms of biostratigraphic continuity—and discontinuity—for as long\nas paleontology has been a discipline. In the nineteenth and twenti­\neth centuries, global biostratigraphic discontinuity was used to ar­\ngue for biological extinction and mass extinction, as well as define\nthe biostratigraphic column. Biostratigraphic continuity at particular\ntaxonomic levels has been used to argue for everything from species\nstasis (e.g., Eldredge and Gould 1972) to class-level evolutionary\nfaunas (Sepkoski 1981). In creationism, biostratigraphic continuity\nhas been used to argue both for biological change (Wood et al. 2003)\nand against biological change (e.g., Scheven 1990). Biostratigraphic\ndiscontinuity has been used to identify the pre-Flood/Flood bound­\nary (e.g., Austin and Wise 1994), and the Flood/post-Flood bound­\nary (e.g., Ross 2012). For these reasons, we believe biostratigraphic\ncontinuity—especially global biostratigraphic continuity—has great\npotential in providing creationist insight into earth history. In this\npaper, then, we will extract biostratigraphic continuity data from the\nPBDB. Since multiple measures of biostratigraphic continuity are\npossible, and we will only use one in this paper, we believe this could\nKurt P.

This is because\nfiner-scale data typically leads to clearer understanding, and more\nconvincing conclusions. Future research can use coarser-scale data\nin those cases where the finest scale data are unavailable or unsat­\nisfactorily rare. Biostratigraphic continuity is indicated when a par­\nticular taxon is found in two successive stratigraphic units within\na particular geographic area. Thus biostratigraphic continuity uses\ntaxonomic, stratigraphic, and geographic data. Since the finest-scale\ntaxonomic identification of the greatest majority of PBDB fossils is\nthe species, we use a species-level biostratigraphic continuity mea­\nsure. Since the stage is the finest-scale global stratigraphic unit re­\nported for the vast majority of Phanerozoic PBDB fossils, we also\nuse a stage-level stratigraphic continuity measure in the Phanerozoic.\nIn the case of Proterozoic and Archean fossils, the PBDB’s finest\nglobal stratigraphic resolution is the system and erathem, respective­\nly. Thus the stratigraphic scales we use in the Archean and Protero­\nzoic are the erathem and system, respectively. Requiring a taxon to\nbe found in both the stratigraphic unit immediately below and above\nthe boundary is a further refinement of scale for it omits taxa that are\nnot found right up against the boundary. Finally, the PBDB reports\nfossil location with GPS coordinates and an estimate of GPS pre­\ncision. Since the precision is most often given in qualitative terms\n(e.g., ‘minutes’ or ‘seconds’), an ‘average’ precision can only be esti­\nmated roughly, but it seems to be between 1 and 2 degrees of latitude\nand longitude. Thus, we use a biostratigraphic continuity measure of\ntwo degrees latitude and longitude. Our paleontological continuity\nmeasure, then, for the Phanerozoic is the number of species reported\nin both the stage below and the stage above a particular stage-stage\nboundary within 2 degrees longitude and latitude. We use the same\nmeasure for Archean and Proterozoic fossils, substituting (in place of\nstage) erathem and system, respectively. We call this the Number of\nLocal, Stage boundary-Straddling Species (NLSSS).\nWe determined the NLSSS for the 100 stage-stage boundaries of\nthe Phanerozoic, the 10 system-system boundaries of the Proterozo­\nic, and the 4 erathem-erathem boundaries of the Archean. For each\nboundary, we downloaded two files from the Paleobiology Database\n(PBDB; paleobiodb.org)—one for all the taxa reported in the global\nstratigraphic unit immediately below the boundary and one for all\nthe taxa reported in the global stratigraphic unit immediately above\nthe boundary. Each of these files was processed to the taxonomic\nlevel of species by deleting all records identified less precisely than\nthe species level, and considering only at the species level those re­\ncords identified more precisely than the species level. Each file was\nalso processed to the proper stratigraphic level by deleting all re­\ncords that located the fossil less precisely than the Phanerozoic stage\n(or Proterozoic system or Archean erathem). Some of the biostrati­\ngraphic data of the PBDB is given in regionally-defined stages, as\nopposed to globally-defined stages. Desiring to include as much data\nas possible, we accepted a regional stage boundary as equivalent to a\nglobally-defined stage boundary when the radiometric ages of those\nboundaries was less than two million radiometric years apart. Given\nthe fact that radiometric years are most probably an extreme exag­\ngeration of real years, a difference of two million radiometric years is\nhere considered small enough to suggest they are more or less simul­\ntaneous boundaries, even though they are found at different places\non the earth. The average stage length through the Phanerozoic was\n10.4 million radiometric years. The two million years was an arbi­\ntrary value less than one quarter that average stage length. We set\nthis criterion less in the case of boundaries atop stages less than two\nmillion radiometric years long. For the two uppermost stage/stage\nboundaries, this criterion was set to zero, and for the remaining short\nstages, this criterion was set to one million radiometric years.\nThen, for each of the 114 globally-defined stratigraphic boundaries,\nthe two files (the file with species below the boundary and the file\nwith species above the boundary) were combined into a single file.\nFrom that file, all records were deleted for species found only on one\nside of the boundary. Then, for each species in that file, all records\nwere deleted that were located more than two degrees latitude or\nlongitude (greater than about 200-300 miles) from all other occur­\nrences on the opposite side of the boundary. The records remaining\nin this file, then, are all records of species found on both sides of the\nboundary within two degrees longitude and latitude. The count of\nhow many different species are found in this final file is the NLSSS\nfor this stratigraphic boundary.\nRESULTS\nThe results are given in Table 1. For brevity in referring to particu­\nlar stratigraphic boundaries, each of the 114 stratigraphic boundaries\nwas assigned a number from 1 for the oldest boundary to 114 for the\nmost recent boundary (column A). For each boundary, the number\nof different species reported in the PBDB from the globally-defined\nstratigraphic unit below the boundary is given in column B, and the\nNLSSS for that boundary is given in column C. The percentage of\nspecies in the stratigraphic unit below that boundary that straddle the\nboundary is given in column F (as %NLSSS). Columns C and F are\ngraphed in Figure 1.\nThe results of our analysis are robust with respect to the most arbi­\ntrary decisions we made in our analysis. First, to include as many\nlocal biostratigraphic units as possible, we equated them with the\nclosest global stratigraphic unit if their radiometric ages differed\nby as much as two million years. The results were not substantially\nchanged by reducing that difference to one million radiometric years.\nSecond, we assumed fossils were reported from the same location if\nthey were reported in the PBDB within 2 degrees longitude or lati­\ntude. The results were not substantially changed by using 1, 3, or 4\ndegrees of longitude and latitude.\nA visual (qualitative) inspection of Figure 1 suggests five different\nbiostratigraphic zones, as defined by NLSSS pattern:\nThe Precambrian-Cambrian zone (boundaries 1-25) is characterized\nby very low to zero NLSSS values. This zone includes all the Ar­\nchean erathem boundaries (1-5), all the Proterozoic system bound­\naries (5-15), and all the Cambrian stage boundaries (15-25). The\nonly non-zero NLSSS values are boundaries 9-10, 15-16, and 21\n(PBDB-reported radiometric year ages of 1800-1400, 541-529, and\n500.5, respectively).\nThe Ordovician-Mississippian zone (boundaries 25-49) is character­\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n612\n",

The Boundary column lists the global stratigraphic boundaries utilized by the PBDB, arranged from the oldest at the top to the youngest at the\nbottom, identified with the names of the underlying and overlying stratigraphic units, separated by a forward slash. Note that the numbered ‘Cambrian stage’\nunits have not yet been given formal stage names (thus they are denoted by a lower case ‘stage’ and a number 1 through 10). Column A numbers the strati­\ngraphic boundaries from the oldest to the youngest for easy reference in the text. Column B is the total number of different species reported in the PBDB\nin the global stratigraphic unit below the boundary. Column C is the Number of Local Stage-Straddling Species (NLSSS) for that boundary (the number of\ndifferent species from PBDB data that are found in the global stratigraphic unit below and above the boundary at locations within 2 degrees longitude and\nlatitude of one another). Column D is the percent change in NLSSS from the previous boundary. Column E is the total percent change in NLSSS in those cas­\nes where the NLSSS has increased or decreased over multiple successive boundaries. Column F is the %NLSSS (the percent of species below the boundary\nthat straddle the boundary—i.e., column C divided by column B). Column G is the percentage change in %NLSSS from the previous boundary. Column H is\nthe total percent change in %NLSSS in those cases where the %NLSSS has increased or decreased over multiple successive boundaries. Column I is the rank\nof a mass extinction’s intensity that occurred at or near the boundary. This rank is based on the average of several genus-level extinction studies, beginning\nwith the most substantial extinction as a 1. Column J is North American megasequence data (B denoting the approximate beginning of the megasequence, P\ndenoting the approximate peak, and E denoting the approximate termination of the megasequence). The last column contains the higher global stratigraphic\nunits that bound at the same level, with the unit below the boundary mentioned first and the unit above the boundary mentioned second.\n",

This zone includes all but the low­\nest stage boundary of the Cenozoic erathem (93-114), the Tertiary\nsub-erathem (93-111), and the Paleogene system (93-102), as well\nas all the stage boundaries of the Quaternary sub-erathem (111-114)\nand the Neogene system (102-114). NLSSS values vary from 76\n(boundaries 94-95) to 1011 (boundary 113). %NLSSS values vary\nfrom 6% (boundaries 94-95) to 40% (boundary 113).\nOverall, the two most similar patterns seem to be the Ordovi­\ncian-Mississippian and Mesozoic zones, with the latter showing a\nhigher amplitude. In our visual inspection, we also see a potential\nepisodic pattern in the Cenozoic zone (and even more so in the Me­\nsozoic zone). So, we will be testing the NLSSS pattern for period­\nized by low to moderate NLSSS values. This zone includes all stage\nboundaries of the Ordovician (25-32), Silurian (32-40), and Devo­\nnian (40-47) systems and the stage boundaries of the Pennsylvanian\nsubsystem (47-49).\nThe Pennsylvanian-Permian zone (boundaries 49-63) is character­\nized by very high NLSSS values. This zone includes the two upper­\nmost Mississippian subsystem stage boundaries (49-50), and all the\nstage boundaries of the Pennsylvanian subsystem (50-54) and the\nPermian system (54-63).\nThe Mesozoic zone (boundaries 63-94) is characterized by low to\nhigh NLSSS values. This zone includes the two lowest boundaries\n(93-94) of the Cenozoic erathem (and Tertiary sub-erathem, and\nPaleogene system), as well as all the boundaries of the Mesozoic\nerathem (63-93) and the Triassic (63-70), Jurassic (70-81), and Cre­\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n615\n",

The Precambrian-Cambrian zone (boundaries 1-25)\n1. Precambrian fossilization potential\nTwo observations in the Precambrian data might lead to the im­\npression that fossils are absent from Precambrian sediments. First,\nalthough the global stratigraphic units utilized by the PBDB are\nbio -stratigraphic units from the Ediacaran up, the sub-Ediacaran\nunits are not. This might suggest that fossils are unavailable to de­\nfine Precambrian stratigraphic units. Second, the zeros in column\nB of Table 1 might suggest that no fossils at all are found in five\nof the 14 globally defined stratigraphic units of the Precambrian.\nConcerning non-fossil definitions of Precambrian stratigraphic units,\nfew sub-Ediacaran fossils show specificity to particular stratigraphic\nlevels. In fact, the PBDB reports fossils in every globally-defined\nstratigraphic unit of the Precambrian-Cambrian zone. It is just that\nfew of them have a narrow enough stratigraphic range to be use­\nful for biostratigraphy. Concerning the zeros in column B of Table\n1, many of the fossil taxa in the Precambrian-Cambrian zone are\nsimply not reported at the species level. So again, all the globally\ndefined Precambrian stratigraphic units contain fossils. It is just that\nfew of those fossils are identified at the species level. So, unlike\nHunter (2000a, 2000b) claims, not only are Precambrian sediments\nquite capable of preserving fossils, they, in fact, do contain fossils.\n2. Biostratigraphic pulses in the Precambrian-Cambrian zone\nThere is too little data in the Precambrian-Cambrian zone to place\nstatistical confidence on quantitative tests of periodicity. Qualitative­\nly, however, there seems to be no evidence of periodicity in the ra­\ndiometric ages of stage boundaries or their logarithms (in case there\nis exponential change in decay rates during the deposition of these\nstratigraphic units). However, there may be regularity in the NLSSS\nzeros and highs. A rough test of periodicity for every 2 nd boundary\nwas performed by (1) summing the %NLSSS values (column F, Ta­\nble 1) for every 2 nd boundary starting at boundary 1 (2s 1 ), then sum­\nming the %NLSSS values for every 2 nd boundary starting at bound­\nary 2 (2s 2 ), (2) calculating the percentage that each of these sums are\nof the sum of all %NLSSS values (2p 1 and 2p 2 ), and (3) comparing\nthese percentages with what would be expected if there was no 2 nd\nboundary periodicity (1/2 = 50%). The same test was performed for\nperiodicity for every 3 rd boundary (by summing %NLSSS values for\nevery 3 rd boundary to get 3s 1 , 3s 2 , and 3s 3 , then comparing calculated\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n616\n",

This test is similar\nto the one used by Raup and Sepkoski (1984) to identify a 28-mil­\nlion-radiometric-year periodicity in mass extinctions. The results of\nthis periodicity test are found in Table 2. The largest deviations from\nnon-periodicity for NLSSS peaks are every five boundaries starting\nwith boundary 1 (3.8 times the value expected in non-periodic data)\nand every six boundaries starting with boundary 4 (3.6 times the val­\nue expected in non-periodic data). Visually, this is seen by NLSSS\npeaks at boundaries 10, 16, 21 (and 26) lying very close to every 5 th\nboundary beginning with boundary 1 (1, 6, 11, 16, 21 [and 26]), as\nwell as every 6 th boundary beginning with boundary 4 (4, 10, 16, 22).\nA visual inspection of peaks in species diversity (column B, Table\n1) below boundaries 3, 5, 9, 13, 15, 18, and 22 may also indicate\nspecies diversity peaks in every 3 rd stratigraphic unit. These obser­\nvations seem to offer sufficient warrant to at least further investigate\nperiodicity in future studies. Since studies of this nature should oper­\nate on more data, we recommend using a coarser taxonomic measure\n(e.g., of genera and/or families). This should substantially increase\nthe available data since many fossils in the Precambrian-Cambrian\nzone are identified no more precisely than the genus, or even family.\nDemonstrating periodicity in the Precambrian-Cambrian NLSSS\ndata, however, does not automatically demonstrate any sort of pe­\nriodicity in time or process. With respect to time, the good news is\nthat the International Commission on Stratigraphy is attempting to\nmake all stratigraphic units of a given level (all stages, all series, etc)\nroughly the same length, albeit in radiometric years. The bad news\nis that the finest globally defined stratigraphic units currently defined\nin the Precambrian-Cambrian zone are erathems in the Archean,\nsystems in the Proterozoic, and stages in the Cambrian. The result\nis that the stratigraphic units between boundaries 1-25 decrease in\nradiometric length by two orders of magnitude. In fact, a majority\nof that decrease occurs between the Precambrian and Cambrian. The\nfour Archean (erathem) units average 375 million radiometric years\nin length, the ten Proterozoic (system) units average 225, and the ten\nCambrian (stage) units 5.6. It is not immediately evident how radio­\nmetric time is to be converted to true time. Thus, it may be difficult\ndemonstrating that periodicity in NLSSS data is actually periodicity\nin time. With respect to periodicity of process, the different strati­\ngraphic units of the Precambrian-Cambrian zone may have resulted\nfrom very different processes operating at very different periods of\nearth history. If the pre-Flood/Flood boundary is at boundary 13, as\nsuggested by Austin and Wise (1994), fossils between boundaries 13\nand 25 were buried in the Flood. If the oldest Precambrian fossils\nwere buried in the Day 3 Regression, as suggested by Wise (1992),\nthe lower part of the Precambrian-Cambrian zone was formed in\nthe Creation Week. It may also turn out that some of the Precambri­\nan-Cambrian zone sediments were formed after the Creation Week\nand before the Flood. Thus some Precambrian-Cambrian zone fossils\nmay have formed as part of God’s creative activity in the Creation\nWeek, some through more ‘normal’ processes of antediluvian times,\nand some as part of God’s judgment during the Flood. Thus, it may\nbe difficult demonstrating that periodicity in NLSSS data translates\nto periodicity of the same process or processes.\nPeriodicity in time or process may or may not be demonstrated in\nNLSSS data. However, significantly high and low NLSSS values\nstill suggest non-uniformity of process. It might be that they point to\ndifferent processes operating at different times (e.g., Creation Week\nversus antediluvian versus Flood processes). Or, they may indicate\nsimilar processes operating at different rates—again, e.g., at different\ntimes of earth history. Or, if they are found to occur within a sin­\ngle catastrophic event—such as during the Day 3 Regression or the\nFlood—they may point to processes capable of separating different\ncohorts of organisms into different strata. Or, they may point to a\ncombination of these possibilities (and perhaps other possibilities we\nhave not yet considered). In any case, the variable NLSSS values of\nthe Precambrian-Cambrian zone should be examined more carefully.\n3. The pre-Flood/Flood boundary\nIn the creation model, we would expect the pre-Flood/Flood bound­\nary to be located in the lower part of the stratigraphic column. Fur­\nthermore, in theory, either the species diversity data of column B in\nTable 1 or the NLSSS data of column C in Table 1 could—in prin­\nciple, anyway—be used to identify the pre-Flood/Flood boundary\nin at least two different ways. Regarding the species diversity data,\ncreationists have long believed that the Flood involved a marked\nincrease in the burial rate of organisms (over whatever the burial\nrate of organisms was in pre-Flood times). Unless the catastrophism\nof the earliest Flood was so great as to destroy the organisms—and\nthus leave no fossils—creationists would expect a marked increase\nin numbers—and diversity—of fossils at the beginning of the Flood.\nHowever, the species diversity in the lowest stratigraphic units of our\nplanet (column B in Table 1) do not show consistently low values (of\nthe pre-Flood world) previous to a sudden increase to consistently\nhigh values (of the Flood). The diversity below boundaries 1-7 is\nconsistently low (as might be expected of the pre-Flood world), and\nthe diversity above boundary 26 is consistently high (as might be\nexpected of the Flood). However, boundaries 8-25 show rises and\nfalls in diversity unexpected in most views of the Flood and the\nworld previous to it. Ad hoc explanations could be devised to explain\nsuch things in the antediluvian world (e.g., periods of pre-Flood cat­\nastrophism to explain diversity highs) or during the Flood (e.g., sec­\ntions of pre-Flood ocean floor lacking organisms to explain diversity\nlows). But in actuality, PBDB species diversity data does not permit\nthe pre-Flood/Flood boundary to be located any more precisely than\nsomewhere between boundaries 8 and 25.\nRegarding the use of NLSSS data to identify the pre-Flood/Flood\nboundary, creationists almost  universally believe that the early Flood\ninvolved considerable transport. The geographic ranges of pre-Flood\norganisms are usually assumed to be constant or changing very slow­\nly between the Creation and the Flood. Thus, if fossils formed in\nsuccessive layers in the pre-Flood world, species found in one layer\nshould be found in the next layer in the same geographic locality.\nThus if fossilization occurred over the course of antediluvian times,\nNLSSS values would be high in pre-Flood sediments. On the other\nhand, if the early Flood was as catastrophic as creationists usually\nassume, species would be carried from where they lived in pre-Flood\ntimes to be buried in very different locations. Pre-Flood fossils of a\nspecies would not be expected to be in the same geographic location\nas the earliest Flood fossils of that same species. We would expect\nzero or near-zero NLSSS values for the pre-Flood/Flood boundary.\nHowever, once a species has been picked up by the Flood waters,\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n617\n",

And, if the pre-Flood/Flood boundary is at\nboundary 13 as Austin and Wise (1994) argue, low %NLSSS values\nin boundaries 8-12 suggest most of the pre-Flood sediments were\nnot deposited over a long period of time. Thus, pre-Flood sediments\nwere most probably deposited under catastrophic conditions, at rates\nwell above those hypothesized by non-creationist geologists. This\nhypothesis can be tested by re-examining this zone with a NLSSG\n(genus-level) and/or NLSSF (family-level) paleontological continu­\nity criterion.\n6. Early Flood biozonation\nCreationists almost universally assign Cambrian sediments to the\nFlood. Yet, only 59 (5.2%) of 1133 species reported from a Cam­\nbrian stage are reported also in the following stage. None of the 71\nspecies below boundary 18 are reported from the following stage,\nand none of the 34 below boundary 20, and none of 460 species\nbelow boundary 22. This suggests strong species-level biozonation\nat the stage level in the Cambrian. Wise (2003a) argued that the bio­\nstratigraphic zones of the Ediacaran and lowest Cambrian might be\nexplained by fining upward deposition at the initiation of the Flood.\nThe entire Cambrian is within the Sauk megasequence, and the Sauk\nis characterized by fining upward sedimentation. In future research\nwe will be pursuing the possibility that the decreasing depositional\nenergy of the Sauk megasequence may be responsible for the strong\nbiozonation in Cambrian sediments.\nB. The Cenozoic zone (boundaries 94-114)\n1. The Flood/post-Flood boundary\nIn the creation model, we would expect the Flood/post-Flood bound­\nary to be located in the upper part of the stratigraphic column.\nThus, we might expect the Flood/post-Flood boundary to be locat­\ned somewhere in the uppermost NLSSS biostratigraphic zone—i.e.,\nthe Cenozoic zone. And, just as NLSSS data could, in principle, be\nused to define the pre-Flood/Flood boundary, so also NLSSS data\ncan be used to define the Flood/post-Flood boundary. As claimed\nabove, once a species was picked up (and killed) by the Flood waters,\nthat same species will continue to be deposited in successive Flood\nsediments until all members of that species have been buried or de­\nstroyed. Thus, a fossil species found in a particular Flood sediment\nat some geographic location might well be found also in the next\nFlood sediment at that same location. Thus, successive Flood layers\nshould show high NLSSS values for species killed in the Flood. Al­\nthough the Flood was designed to kill all terrestrial animals, some\nmarine species may not have been killed by Flood waters. In fact\nthe nutrient-rich waters of the Flood may have allowed some marine\nspecies to flourish, reproduce and multiply. Such Flood-compatible\norganisms with short enough generation times—especially bacteria,\nprotists, and algae—may have even been able to adapt to local con­\nditions in the course of the Flood. Given that these organisms might\nlive at the same locality through the deposition of multiple sedimen­\ntary units of the Flood, they should also show high NLSSS values.\nThus, we would expect high NLSSS values for organisms of all types\nthroughout Flood sediments. We would also expect high NLSSS val­\nues for organisms of all types in post-Flood sediments. This is be­\ncause organisms that lived in a particular area while one stratigraphic\nunit was being deposited are very likely to live in the same area while\nthe next stratigraphic unit was being deposited in that same area. In\ncontrast, we would not expect high NLSSS values across the Flood/\npost-Flood boundary. If any marine species killed off by the Flood\nwas buried in a particular location by Flood sediments, the Flood’s\nwholescale rearrangement of the marine realm would make it very\nunlikely that that species’ Flood survivors would come to inhabit the\nsame geographic location. The only exceptions might be some of\nthe species that actually thrived in Flood waters. Such species could\npotentially find an acceptable marine habitat before the end of the\nFlood and persist in that habitat following the Flood. For terrestrial\norganisms this is not possible, for the only terrestrial animals that\nsurvived the Flood did so on the ark. If all the Flood fossils for a\nparticular terrestrial species were restricted to a small geographical\narea, it would be extremely unlikely that the members of the species\ncoming out of the ark would establish their post-Flood habitation\nat that same spot. NLSSS values for terrestrial organisms might be\nhigh in Flood and post-Flood sediments, but should be zero across\nthe Flood/post-Flood boundary. Consequently, we would expect high\nNLSSS values below and above the Flood/post-Flood boundary, but\nzero NLSSS values at the boundary (except for marine species that\nestablished themselves before the end of the Flood).\nThe very high NLSSS values in the Cenozoic zone seem incompat­\nible with a Flood/post-Flood boundary anywhere after boundary 95\n(low in the Cenozoic). If the Flood/post-Flood boundary was located\nat any of these stage-stage boundaries, hundreds of species would be\nburied in the same geographic area on each side of that boundary.\nIn a similar manner, Ross (2012) claimed that scores of terrestrial\nmammal genera (and families) on both sides of the Tertiary/Qua­\nternary (T/Q) boundary in North America argue very persuasively\nagainst the Flood/post-Flood boundary at the T/Q boundary in North\nAmerica. It seems too improbable for even one terrestrial mammal to\nleave the ark after the Flood, travel to a location half-way around the\nworld, and settle in the very same area where members of its genus\nwere buried in the Flood. For this to happen for scores of different\nmammal genera (and families) makes it impossible for the Flood/\npost-Flood boundary in North America to be located at the Tertiary/\nQuaternary boundary. There are two ways in which our analysis is\neven more definitive than Ross’. First, it is much less probable that a\nparticular species will reinhabit the same geographic location than it\nis for any species of a given genus (or family) to reinhabit the same\ngeographic location. Second, it is far less probable to relocate within\n2 degrees longitude and latitude than it is to relocate somewhere on\nthe same continent. Furthermore, our analysis broadens Ross’s con­\nclusions from just the T/Q boundary (our boundary 111) to all bio­\nstratigraphic boundaries, and from just North America to the entire\nglobe. Ross concluded that the Flood/post-Flood boundary cannot\nbe at the T/Q boundary in North America. Our analysis concludes\nthat the Flood/post-Flood boundary cannot be anywhere in the Neo­\ngene or upper Paleogene anywhere in the world. All this having been\nsaid, however, there is one sense in which Ross’s (2012) analysis was\nmore effective than ours in identifying the Flood/post-Flood bound­\nary. Ross only utilized terrestrial mammals, and for such organisms\nwe would expect an unambiguous NLSSS value of zero at the Flood/\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n619\n",

For our analysis to be a definitive argument against a\nmiddle or upper Cenozoic Flood/post-Flood boundary, it should be\nrepeated on entirely terrestrial organisms.\nAn interesting peculiarity of earth history suggests yet another cri­\nterion for identifying the Flood/post-Flood boundary. As is almost\nuniversally accepted by creationists, continental glaciation occurred\nentirely after the Flood. When continental glaciation was at its max­\nimum, enough water was trapped in continental glaciers to drop\nglobal sea level about 130 meters from post-Flood, pre-glacial times.\nAlthough subsequent melting of these glaciers has raised sea level\nsubstantially, sea level is still about 80 meters below pre-glacial lev­\nels. As a result of this, the lowest 80 meters of super-tidal sediments\non continental margins (and higher sediments that have been tecton­\nically raised since deposition) are marine shelf sediments from post-\nFlood, pre-glacial times. Being above sea level as they are, these\ncoastal plain sediments are easily scoured for fossils, so the PBDB\nhas thousands of records of fossils from post-Flood marine sediments\nthat would otherwise be largely unknown to us if they were still be­\nlow sea level. Because these are places where marine taxa could have\nestablished themselves before the end of the Flood, NLSSS values\ncould be high in coastal plain sediments around the world. Thus, the\nNLSSS values for terrestrial taxa should be high everywhere below\nthe Flood/post-Flood boundary, zero at the boundary, and high on\nthe continents interior to their coastal plain sediments and zero else­\nwhere. At the same time, NLSSS values for marine taxa below the\nFlood/post-Flood boundary will be high everywhere, and above the\nFlood/post-Flood boundary should be high in coastal plain sediments\nand zero on the continents interior to their coastal plain sediments.\nWhen we examined the boundary-straddling species of the Cenozoic\nzone, terrestrial taxa were almost exclusively restricted to continen­\ntal localities interior to coastal plain locations. The few exceptions\ncould be explained by terrestrial organisms washed out to sea. For\nthe same boundaries, marine taxa are restricted to coastal plain lo­\ncalities in all areas of the world except one large region—the moun­\ntain chain stretching from central Europe through the Middle East\nand across the top of India. Woodmorappe (1983: map 34) mapped\nthe very same distribution of Cenozoic index fossils. Clarey (2017,\n2020; Clarey and Werner 2019) noted marine sediments in the Ce­\nnozoic of central Europe, Turkey, and the Middle East—i.e., along\nthe same chain of Eurasian mountains. We suspect that a close ex­\namination of the mountain fold-belt stretching from Europe through\nChina will reveal that the Cenozoic marine sediments were all depos­\nited along continental margins just above current sea level, and were\nsubsequently uplifted to modern elevations by late Cenozoic plate\ncollisions. If this hypothesis proves true, all marine boundary-strad­\ndling species worldwide are restricted to coastal plain sediments\nthroughout the Cenozoic and all terrestrial boundary-straddling taxa\nare restricted to the continents interior to the coastal plain sediments\n(except those washed out to sea). We would consider this extremely\nstrong evidence that all or nearly all the Cenozoic is post-Flood.\nDefinitive arguments for the location of the world’s Flood/post-Flood\nboundary must await NLSSS reanalysis of terrestrial vs. marine or­\nganisms and a geologic study of the Eurasian mountains. Howev­\ner, we did examine the terrestrial vs. marine boundary-straddling\nspecies of North America for the location of the Flood/post-Flood\nboundary in North America. Starting with the uppermost stage-stage\nboundary (boundary 114), marine boundary-straddling species are\nrestricted to coastal plain sediments in boundaries 114 through 112,\nabsent altogether in boundary 111, and restricted to coastal plain sed­\niments, again, in boundaries 110 through 94. In contrast, terrestrial\nboundary-straddling taxa are found at continental locations interior\nto coastal plain sediments at boundary 93 down (e.g., at 56 of the 57\ncontinental interior locations at boundary 93, 5 of the 12 at boundary\n92, 2 of the 3 at boundary 91, and 22 of the 23 at boundary 90). This\nstrongly argues that the Flood/post-Flood boundary is located just\nbelow boundary 94—i.e., just below the Danian/Selandian boundary\n(the first biostratigraphic boundary above the Cretaceous/Paleogene\nboundary). The fact that this boundary (and the one following it)\nrepresent a substantial worldwide dip in boundary-straddling spe­\ncies provides further justification for this being the Flood/post-Flood\nboundary in North America.\n2. Biostratigraphic pulses in the Cenozoic zone\nIn the Cenozoic zone there are 6 NLSSS peaks (boundaries 98, 101,\n104, 106, 109, 113) and 5 NLSSS valleys between (boundaries 100,\n102, 105, 108, 111). This alone suggests a periodicity of peaks ev­\nery 3-4 boundaries or so. Our periodicity test did offer mild sup­\nport to NLSSS periodicity (see Table 2). Every 4 th boundary starting\nwith the first boundary, every 5 th boundary starting with the third\nand fourth boundaries, and every 6 th boundary starting with the fifth\nboundary, all sum to values 1½ times the expected value if there was\nno periodicity. Thus the peaks at boundaries 98, 101, 104, 106, 109,\n113, closely correspond to every 4 th beginning with the 1 st (94, 98,\n102, 106, 110, 114), every 5 th beginning with the 3 rd (96, 101, 106,\n111) or 4 th (97, 102, 107, 112), and every 6 th starting with the 5 th (98,\n104, 110).\nAs in the case of the Precambrian-Cambrian zone, however, demon­\nstration of periodicity in Cenozoic NLSSS is not automatically a\ndemonstration of periodicity in time. If the Flood runs from some­\nwhere between boundaries 8 and 25 to about boundary 94, then\nsomewhere between 479 and 1738 million radiometric years elapsed\nduring the year-long Flood, and only 61.6 million radiometric years\nelapsed in the last four and a half thousand years or so. And, if\nLubenow (1992) is correct about Homo erectus being human, then\nthe Old-World-wide distribution of the oldest H. erectus suggests\nthat all of both the Pleistocene and Holocene are post-Babel. That\nwould suggest that 479-1738 million radiometric years elapsed in\n1 Flood year, then about 52.8 million radiometric years elapsed in a\nfew centuries between the Flood and the Babel dispersion, and 1.8\nmillion radiometric years elapsed in the four and half or so thousand\nyears since Babel. As in the case of the Precambrian-Cambrian zone,\nthen, it is not yet clear what the relationship is between radiometric\nand chronological time. Thus, it may be difficult demonstrating that\nperiodicity in NLSSS data is actually periodicity in time.\nEven if the NLSSS peaks in the Cenozoic zone cannot be demon­\nstrated to be periodic, they do seem rather dramatic. Eight bound­\naries show NLSSS increases of 50% or more over the previous\nboundary, and half of those more than doubled (column D, Table 1).\nSeven boundaries show %NLSSS increases of 50% or more over the\nprevious boundary, and four of those more than doubled (column\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n620\n",

Considering total NLSSS increases, even over multiple\nboundaries, there were 6, with total increases of 746%, 72%, 204%,\n90%, 122%, and 845% (columns D and E, Table 1). There were also\n6 such %NLSSS increases (176%, 59%, 470%, 222%, 160%, 429%:\ncolumns G and H, Table 1). Five boundaries show NLSSS decreases\nof 50% or more over the previous boundary (column D, Table 1), and\nthree show %NLSSS decreases of 50% or more (column G, Table 1).\nConsidering total NLSSS decreases, even over multiple boundaries,\nthere were 5 (60%, 58%, 68%, 82%, and 53% (columns D and E, Ta­\nble 1). There were also 4 such %NLSSS decreases (86%, 68%, 62%,\nand 78%: columns G and H, Table 1). Thus, even when NLSSS data\nis normalized to the number of species in the preceding stage—i.e.,\nas %NLSSS data—the rises and drops in NLSSS data are substan­\ntial. As indicated above, substantial changes in NLSSS and %NLSSS\nvalues suggest non-uniformity of process. Investigation of these data\nin the Cenozoic zone may provide insight into surges in post-Flood\ncatastrophism and/or surges in post-Flood diversification.\nB. The Ordovician through Mesozoic zones (boundaries 25-94)\nWith the pre-Flood/Flood boundary in the first NLSSS biostrati­\ngraphic zone, and the Flood/post-Flood boundary in the fifth, the\nsecond through fourth NLSSS biostratigraphic zones (boundaries\n25-94) were deposited in the Flood.\n1. Possible sea-to-land pattern\nFrom at least the time of Clark (1946), creationists have suggested\nthat the oldest animal fossils were marine because the Flood began\nits burial of organisms in the earth’s oceans. This suggests that the\nfirst-order biostratigraphic zonation of Flood sediments might sepa­\nrate a lower marine zone from an upper terrestrial zone. At the same\ntime, since the ark was not designed to carry marine organisms, and\nmarine fossils are found at every stage of the Flood, marine organ­\nisms must have been buried throughout the entire Flood year. Thus,\nthe upper terrestrial zone must contain marine fossils as well as ter­\nrestrial fossils. If we assume that burial processes of the Flood were\nsimilar between the upper and lower zones, the upper zone might dif­\nfer from the lower zone only in the addition of terrestrial organisms.\nWhen terrestrial and marine organisms are not distinguished, the sec­\nond zone may only differ in total species diversity. It strikes us that\nin Figure 1 the 2 nd and 4 th NLSSS biostratigraphic zones look similar,\nexcept that the 4 th has higher amplitude peaks. In fact, the sums of the\nstage-level species diversity (column B, Table 1) in the 4 th zone is 3.4\ntimes that of the 2 nd zone, and the sums of the NLSSS values (column\nC, Table 1) in the 4 th zone is 2.9 times that of the 2 nd zone. We would\nlike to suggest that the 4 th (Mesozoic) zone is the above-mentioned\n‘terrestrial’ zone (containing both terrestrial and marine organisms),\nand the 2 nd (Ordovician-Mississippian) zone is the above-mentioned\n‘marine’ zone (containing only marine organisms). We would expect\nthat if terrestrial and marine taxa were evaluated separately, the ma­\nrine taxa will be similar in both pattern and diversity between the 2 nd\nand 4 th zones, and the terrestrial taxa will be restricted to the 4 th zone,\nbut show a similar NLSSS pattern as the marine taxa in both the 2 nd\nand 4 th zones.\nIf the 2 nd and 4 th zones are the ‘marine’ and ‘terrestrial’ zones of the\nFlood, the 3 rd zone would logically represent Flood sedimentation\nas the ocean began inundating the land. Three other considerations\nsuggest that might be true. First, considerable sand might have been\nlocated at or near pre-Flood shorelines—such as in the form of beach\nsand and/or sand dunes. If so, then considerable sand deposits would\nhave been swept away and deposited by Flood waters as the Flood\nfirst moved onto the land. The extensive sand deposits of the Per­\nmo-Triassic around the world are not only of the right nature for\nthese deposits, but they date from the 3 rd NLSSS biostratigraphic\nzone. Second, Wise (2003b) hypothesized that the pre-Flood ocean\nwas home to a continent-sized floating forest biome. Early Flood\nturmoil might have ripped off and buried the most fragile compo­\nnents of the outermost perimeter of the floating forest (beginning\nwith the fragile plants of the Silurian). However, as long as the float­\ning forest biome was located in deep water, it would probably have\nremained largely intact. No matter how large the waveform, as long\nas the wave did not crest, the floating forest could probably deform\nto, and ride out the waves. It was likely to have been when the float­\ning forest was brought into contact with the edge of the continent\nthat it was systematically torn apart and its components buried. This\nwould likely have been as the Flood began transgressing the land.\nFloating forest organisms are deposited from the upper Silurian into\nthe lower Triassic, with the greatest bulk of them in the Carbonifer­\nous. This suggests that the Flood began transgressing the land some­\nwhere between the upper Silurian and lower Triassic, and most likely\nsomewhere in the Carboniferous. This measure of the transgression\nof the land occurs within or just before the 3 rd NLSSS biostratigraph­\nic zone. Third, the greatest diversity of floating forest organisms is\nin the Pennsylvanian through Permian. Such a large diversity from a\nsingle ecosystem might explain the consistently large NLSSS values\nin the 3 rd NLSSS biostratigraphic zone. Thus, we suggest that the\nPennsylvanian-Permian NLSSS zone represents the Flood’s initial\ninundation of the land. We predict that when the organisms of Flood\nrocks are separated into floating forest organisms versus ‘true’ ma­\nrine organisms versus ‘true’ land organisms, the true marine signature\nwill remain unchanged through all Flood sediments. We also predict\nthat the true land signature will be absent up until somewhere in the\nPennsylvanian-Permian zone, and remain unchanged thereafter.\n2. Biostratigraphic pulses in Flood sediments\nNLSSS peaks are located at boundaries 28, 31, 34, 36, 38, and 44 in\nthe Ordovician-Mississippian zone, boundaries 58, 60, and 62 in the\nPennsylvanian-Permian zone, and boundaries 67, 72, 80, 88, 90, and\n93 in the Cenozoic zone (column C, Table 1). %NLSSS peaks are\nlocated at boundaries 28, 30, 33, 38, 44, 46 in the Ordovician-Missis­\nsippian zone, boundaries 53, 57, 60, 62 in the Pennsylvanian-Perm­\nian zone, and boundaries 67, 69, 71, 77-78, 80, 82, 84, 87, 90 in the\nCenozoic zone (column F, Table 1).\nIn spite of what might appear to be regularity in the data, our period­\nicity test (see above) does not suggest periodicity in Flood sediments\n(see Table 2). Even if the peaks and valleys do not show periodic­\nity, though, like the sediments of the Cenozoic, the peaks and val­\nleys do seem to be substantial. Nineteen boundaries show NLSSS\nincreases of 50% or more over the previous boundary, and eleven\nof those more than doubled (column D, Table 1). Eighteen bound­\naries show %NLSSS increases of 50% or more over the previous\nboundary, and twelve of those more than doubled (column G, Table\n1).

There were also 15\nsuch %NLSSS increases, and 7 of those more than doubled (col­\numns G and H, Table 1). Seven boundaries show NLSSS decreases\nof 50% or more over the previous boundary (column D, Table 1),\nand eleven show %NLSSS decreases of 50% or more (column G,\nTable 1). Considering total decreases, even over multiple boundaries,\n8 NLSSS decreases exceeded 50% (columns D and E, Table 1) and\n12 %NLSSS decreases exceeded 50%. Thus, even when NLSSS data\nis normalized to the number of species in the preceding stage—e.g.,\nas %NLSSS data—the rises and drops in NLSSS data are substan­\ntial. As indicated above, substantial changes in NLSSS and %NLSSS\nvalues suggest non-uniformity of process. Investigation of these data\nin the Flood sediments may provide insight into pre-Flood biozona­\ntion and/or Flood processes that can separate organisms and/or pre­\nserve pre-Flood organismal associations.\n3. NLSSS data and biostratigraphic units and events\nWe have argued that NLSSS data divides the earth’s stratigraphic\ncolumn into five global, biostratigraphic units. The earth’s strati­\ngraphic column has been divided into other global biostratigraphic\nunits for a very long time—many of them for more than a century.\nHow do these biostratigraphic units compare to the NLSSS biostra­\ntigraphic units? At the coarsest scale, the Phanerozoic is divided into\nthe Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic erathems. The last two corre­\nspond rather closely with the Mesozoic and Cenozoic NLSSS zones.\nThe Paleozoic erathem might correspond to the ‘marine’ biozone of\nthe Flood if (1) further study of the Paleozoic-Cambrian zone reas­\nsigns the Cambrian as part of the ‘marine’ biozone of the Flood and\n(2) taking out the floating forest organisms also unites the Pennsyl­\nvanian-Permian NLSSS zone to the ‘marine’ biozone of the Flood.\nIf so, then (roughly speaking) the Cenozoic erathem and NLSSS\nzone are both post-Flood, the Mesozoic erathem and NLSSS zone\nare the ‘terrestrial’ biozone of the Flood, the Paleozoic erathem and\nNLSSS zone are the ‘marine’ biozone of the Flood, and the Precam­\nbrian would be pre-Flood. Erathems, then, may well be evidenced in\nNLSSS data.\nHowever, none of the biostratigraphic divisions of the erathems\ndown to the level of stages (e.g., series and/or systems) are evidenced\nin NLSSS data. We see nothing in the NLSSS or %NLSSS data (col­\numns C or F, Table 1) that seems to consistently match any of the\nsystem or series boundaries (far right column, Table 1). Lyell created\nthe first divisions of the Cenozoic based on the percent living mol­\nlusk species, but almost all biostratigraphic divisions of the erathems\nhave, since then, been defined with respect to ‘index fossils’. Index\nfossils are geographically widespread taxa (optimally global) that are\nrestricted to one narrow zone of the stratigraphic column. The lack of\ncorrelation between NLSSS data and any biostratigraphic zones be­\ntween the stage and the erathem, suggests ‘index fossils’ might carry\nno special signature other than their very particular biostratigraphic\nposition.\n‘Mass extinctions’ are not biostratigraphic units. But, ‘mass extinc­\ntions’ are positions in the global biostratigraphic column where a\nlarge percentage of taxa below that position are never seen above\nthat position. In principle, the disappearance of many taxa across a\nboundary would imply a change in organismal composition from one\nstratigraphic unit to the next. If enough taxa disappeared, this would\nresult in a biostratigraphic boundary. The more global the disappear­\nance, the more global will be the biostratigraphic boundary. One\nwould then expect ‘mass extinctions’ to be found at biostratigraphic\nboundaries, and the largest ‘mass extinctions’ at the coarsest biostra­\ntigraphic boundaries. One would also expect sudden drops in num­\nber of taxa to correspond to very low NLSSS values. Since ‘mass\nextinctions’ are nothing more than higher than ‘normal’ ‘extinction\nrate,’ they are arbitrarily defined. There is no consensus on what is a\n‘higher than normal’ extinction rate. There is also no consensus on\nhow to measure the relative size of different ‘mass extinction’ events.\nHowever, column I in Table 1 lists the twelve most substantial ‘mass\nextinctions’ according to a roughly estimated rank (with ‘1’ exhibit­\ning the highest ‘extinction rate’). As we might expect, the 1 st - and 3 rd -\nranked ‘mass extinctions’ do correspond to the boundaries between\nthe three erathems and the upper three NLSSS biostratigraphic zones\n(comparing C, I, and far right columns, Table 1). The 1 st -ranked\n‘mass extinction’ also corresponds to the largest percentage drop in\n%NLSSS values (column G, Table 1). The 2 nd -, 4 th -, and 5 th -ranked\n‘mass extinctions’ do correspond to system boundaries, but the rela­\ntionship between ‘mass extinctions’ and biostratigraphic boundaries\nblurs after that. Most of the ‘mass extinctions’ are at or near drops\nin NLSSS values, but there does not seem to be a relationship be­\ntween the ranking of ‘mass extinctions’ and the percentage drop in\n%NLSSS values (columns F versus I, Table 1). ‘Mass extinctions,’\nthen, like NLSSS values, do not seem to strongly support the system\nand series divisions of the erathems.\n4. Megasequences and biostratigraphic data\nSloss’s (1964) North American megasequences can be documented\nglobally (e.g., Clarey and Werner 2018). The last of Sloss’s ‘megase­\nquences’—the Tejas—is not bound above by an unconformity, nor is\nit characterized by fining upward clastics topped by a carbonate, nor\nare its distinct lithologies typically traceable across continents. The\nother five (the Sauk, the Tippecanoe, the Kaskaskia, the Absaroka,\nand the Zuni) are megasequences sensu stricto (unconformity-bound\nsequences of continent-wide, fining upward clastics, topped with\ncontinent-wide carbonate). Each megasequence sensu stricto sug­\ngests an enormous global surge in water energy followed by dimi­\nnution of energy. And, since each one of them left sediments in the\ninterior of continents, they each appear to be global inundations in­\ndicative of the Flood. Alone, these five megasequences suggest the\nFlood ran from the Tonian/Cryogenian boundary (boundary 13) to\nthe Danian/Selandian boundary (boundary 94). This is consistent\nwith the Flood boundaries derived from NLSSS data (somewhere\nbetween boundary 8 and 25 to boundary 94).\nBeyond the overall beginning and ending of the Flood, however,\nthere does not seem to be any correlation between megasequences\nsensu stricto and either the NLSSS data or the biostratigraphic divi­\nsions of the stratigraphic column. We see no connection between the\nbeginnings, the peaks, or the terminations of the five megasequences\nsensu stricto (column J, Table 1) and either NLSSS or %NLSSS data\n(columns C and F, Table 1). Nor do these megasequence features\nseem to bear any relationship to divisions of the biostratigraphic col­\numn (far right column, Table 1). Nor do these megasequence features\nseem to bear relationship to ‘mass extinction’ events (column J, Ta­\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n622\n",

Although the Cretaceous/Paleogene ‘extinction’ event is close\nto the end of the Zuni megasequence, the largest ‘extinction’ event\n(that of the Permo-Triassic) has no special relation to the Absaroka\nmegasequence in which it is found. The lack of correlation between\nmegasequences and biostratigraphy is a curious phenomenon. It\nwould seem that the sequence of burial of organisms was not at all\naffected by the changing energy levels of Flood waters. Whatever\ncaused the remarkable boosts in energy required to explain these me­\ngasequences, did not affect the order of burial of organisms.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nDistinct NLSSS patterns and amplitudes suggest the earth’s strati­\ngraphic column can be divided into five NLSSS biostratigraphic\nzones. The first zone includes the Precambrian and Cambrian, the\nsecond the Ordovician through all but the last stage of the Mississip­\npian, the third the last stage of the Mississippian through the Perm­\nian, the fourth the Mesozoic and lowermost stage of the Cenozoic,\nand the fifth the Cenozoic above its lowest stage. The low strati­\ngraphic position and the zero NLSSS values strongly suggest the\npre-Flood/Flood boundary lies in the upper part of the first (Precam­\nbrian-Cambrian) zone. The high stratigraphic position and the very\nhigh NLSSS values strongly suggest the Flood/post-Flood boundary\nlies in the lower part of the fifth (Cenozoic) zone. This, in turn, sug­\ngests that the second, third, and fourth zones (Ordovician through\nCretaceous) are Flood sediments. When the second and fourth zones\nare compared, the second zone’s lower stratigraphic position, similar\nNLSSS pattern, and lower amplitude NLSSS values suggest that the\nOrdovician through Mississippian sediments were deposited during\nthe Flood’s early period of marine burial. The fourth zone was then\ndeposited as the Flood was burying terrestrial organisms. This, in\nturn, suggests that the Pennsylvanian-Permian zone was deposited\naround the time that the Flood began to transgress onto the land.\nDating the initial transgression to the Pennsylvanian-Permian offers\na reasonable source for the world’s Permo-Triassic sands (pre-Flood\ncoastal sands) and a reasonable explanation for the Carboniferous\ncoals (beaching and breakup of the pre-Flood floating forest). All\nthis means that to a first-order approximation, the five NLSSS bio­\nstratigraphic zones correspond to pre-Flood, early (‘marine’) Flood,\ninitial land transgression, late (‘terrestrial’) Flood, and post-Flood,\nrespectively.\nMore specifically on the position of the pre-Flood/Flood boundary,\nNLSSS values suggest a boundary somewhere between the Rhya­\ncian/Orosirian boundary and the Cambrian/Ordovician boundary.\nThe range of candidate boundaries indicated by NLSSS values in­\ncludes the traditional Precambrian/Cambrian boundary popular\namong creationists from at least the time of Clark (1946). It also\nincludes what can be considered the Tonian/Cryogenian refinement\nof the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary suggested by Austin and\nWise (1994). More specifically on the position of the Flood/post-\nFlood boundary, NLSSS values argue very strongly against a bound­\nary in the upper Cenozoic. As powerful as Ross’s (2012) criterion\nwas against an upper Cenozoic Flood/post-Flood boundary in North\nAmerica, this paper’s refinement of that criterion is even more de­\nfinitive. For any potential boundary in the middle or upper Ceno­\nzoic, more than one hundred species of organisms—including land\nanimals—would have to return to the same state- or province-sized\narea where that species was buried in Flood sediments. The Flood/\npost-Flood boundary is most definitely not in the Upper Cenozoic.\nA Danian/Selandian boundary is suggested by global NLSSS data,\nand strongly confirmed by marine versus terrestrial NLSSS data in\nNorth America.\nBeyond its use in distinguishing pre-Flood, Flood, and post-Flood\nsediments, NLSSS research provides insights into processes from\neach portion of earth history. In the Precambrian-Cambrian zone,\nfor example, NLSSS data suggests a variety of different processes\nand/or process rates were involved in pre-Flood and possibly earliest\nFlood sedimentation. Low NLSSS values in the Precambrian-Cam­\nbrian zone also suggest that many of the Precambrian fossils were\nburied under catastrophic conditions—perhaps pointing to cata­\nstrophism during the Creation Week. Furthermore, if the pre-Flood/\nFlood boundary is anywhere near the Precambrian boundary, as is\npopularly believed, the many zero NLSSS values in the Cambrian\nsuggests there is strong biozonation in the earliest Flood sediments.\nConcerning biostratigraphy in general, the global biostratigraphic\ncolumn seems to be real. However, sub-erathem biostratigraphic\nunits show no relationship to known measures of biostratigraphic\ncontinuity. This suggests that index fossils and sub-erathem biostra­\ntigraphic units do not provide useful insight into earth history be­\nyond giving us a relative time scale. Concerning lithostratigraphy in\ngeneral, megasequences sensu stricto seem to be real phenomena.\nHowever, with the possible exception of the Cambrian, there may\nbe no relationship between the litho- and bio-stratigraphic columns.\nThis suggests that the order in which the Flood buried fossils bore no\nrelationship to fluctuations in Flood energy. At the same time, strong\nfluctuations in NLSSS values indicate that the fossil record shows\nstrong biozonation. These fluctuations may even be episodic. Such\nbiozonation probably provides valuable information about both bio­\ngeography and burial processes before, during, and after the Flood.\nThis paper suggests a number of future research projects. For exam­\nple, the Precambrian-Cambrian NLSSS zone should be re-evaluated\nat the genus and family levels. We believe this will provide an effec­\ntive test of Austin and Wise’s (1994) hypothesis of the pre-Flood/\nFlood boundary at the Tonian/Cryogenian boundary. We believe it\nwill also advance theories about the role of Creation Week versus\nantediluvian processes in generating Precambrian sediments. Com­\nbining such a reanalysis with lithologic data, will also determine if\nWise’s explanation of biozonation at the edges of pre-Flood conti­\nnents can be extended to explain the biostratigraphy of the entire\nCambrian. Flood sediments should also be re-evaluated while teas­\ning apart ‘true’ marine vs. floating forest vs. ‘true’ terrestrial organ­\nisms. This reanalysis should provide a test of both Wise’s (1994)\nfloating forest hypothesis and this paper’s suggestion that the Flood\ntransitioned from the oceans to the land sometime in the Pennsyl­\nvanian-Permian NLSSS biozone. The entire stratigraphic column\nshould also be reanalyzed separating marine and terrestrial organ­\nisms. We expect such a reanalysis should provide another criteri­\non for identifying both the pre-Flood/Flood and Flood/post-Flood\nboundaries. The latter study should be supplemented with a geologic\nstudy of the extensive Eurasian mountain system to test this paper’s\nclaim that the marine sediments in those mountains were actually\nlaid down in post-Flood continental shelf sediments (and raised by\nWISE and RICHARDSON Biostratigraphic continuity and earth history 2023 ICC\n623\n",

The speaker [author] as the architect and the hearer [reader] as construc-\ntor must both construe a coherent text through their integration of knowledge and\nmanagement of information.

Hardly any\nthinking person would deny that this chapter is one of the greatest in literature.\nWords can at best only inadequately describe the extraordinary first text of the\nBible and quickly spend the repertoire of superlatives of the English language:\nprofound, majestic, full of grandeur, foundational, fundamental, vast, sweeping,\ntowering, incomparable, unplumbable, and inexhaustible. At the same time it\nhas been described as austere, 8 tranquil, 9 patient, 10 reticent 11 and forgiving. 12\nbelieved that they were writing real history. Sternberg’s main thesis is that the genius\nof Old Testament narrative is that the historiographical, literary and theological (what\nhe calls “ideological”) aspects of the text are not only in balance but dependent on one\nanother in a non-mutually exclusive nexus. On the three-fold character of biblical texts,\nWinther-Nielsen echoes Sternberg: “. . . historical narrative in the Hebrew Bible is an\nintricately woven material or ‘texture’ of historical, literary, and ideological threads”\n(Nielsen, p. 45). On the non-contradictory balance of the literary and historical, Os-\nborne asserts, “While biblical history is presented in narrative form, this by no means\nobviates its status as history. There is no theoretical reason why literary and historical\ninterests cannot coincide, and why the stories cannot be trustworthy representations\nof what really happened” (Osborne, p. 683). Merrill emphasizes the relationship of\nthe historical and the theological and exposes the false dichotomy that a text cannot\nbe both theological and historical, when he writes that the narrative’s “. . . character as\nsacred history — a notion that must never be ignored — does not in any way diminish\nits value as a source of ‘ordinary’ historical information” (Eugene H. Merrill, “Archaeol-\nogy and Biblical History: Its Uses and Abuses,” in Giving the Sense: Understanding and\nUsing Old Testament Historical Text, ed. David M. Howard and Michael A. Grisanti,\np. 74–96 [Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2003], p. 78).\n8 . E.A. Speiser, Genesis: Introduction, Translation and Notes (Garden City, NY: Doubleday\nand Company, Inc., 1964), p. 8.\n9 . U. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis: Part I: From Adam to Noah (Jerusalem:\nThe Magnes Press, 1998), p. 7.\n10 . “Patient” in the context of literary theory means a text’s “ability to endure and survive\nrigorous criticism.” I owe this description of Genesis 1:1–2:3 to John Hotchkiss (chair-\nman of the English department at The Master’s College), which he offered in a private\ncommunication about the qualities of a magisterial literary composition.\n11 . This term, also used by Hotchkiss, means that a text does not say everything; thus, it\nallows room for interpretation.\n12 . “Forgiving” means that a text can survive incorrect interpretation, such as has been\napplied to Genesis 1:1–2:3. It must be said that in light of this avalanche of adulation,\nwhich has been heaped upon this text, the words “incoherent” (Bruce K. Waltke, Literary\nform of Genesis 1:1–2:4a, p. 1–20 [unpublished paper presented at Dallas Theological\nSeminary, 2004], p. 11) or “messy,” (Peter Enns, Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals\nand the Problem of the Old Testament [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2005], p. 109), which\nalso have been used to describe it, seem oddly out of step.

Beale, “Myth, History, and Inspiration: A Review\nArticle” of Inspiration and Incarnation by Peter Enns,” JETS 49/2 (2006): p. 287–312.\n",

Sainte-Beuve de-\nfines a “classic” as literature that enriches the human mind, increases its treasure,\nadvances it a step, is broad and great, refined, sensible, sane, beautiful in itself,\nwhich has spoken to all in a unique way, easily contemporary with all time, a\ntext with uniformity, wisdom, moderation and reason, a text which is elegant,\nclear, noble and has an airily veiled strength. 13\nBut perhaps it is the word “sublime,” which best apprehends these 34 verses.\nIn his essay, “On the Sublime,” Longinus characterizes sublime literature as lit-\nerature that transports the reader. It has a spark that leaps from the soul of the\nauthor to the soul of the reader. There is an echo of greatness of spirit (of the\nauthor). It contains great thoughts and stirs noble feelings. 14\nSo, in every sense, it is a magisterial text in that one never tires of reading\nit, it invites a closer reading, it inspires awe and wonder and deep respect, and\nit lies at the foundation of worldviews. The literary aspects of the text will be\nexplored in Section 2.2 below.\nThe second characteristic of Genesis 1:1–2:3 is that it is a foundational theo-\nlogical treatise . It is the foundation of Christian theology: our God, our Savior, is\nboth Creator and Redeemer. In addition, it presents a powerful polemic against\nthe prevalent polytheism of the Ancient Near East. These ideas will be further\ndeveloped in Section 2.3 below.\nThe third characteristic goes to the heart of the matter: Genesis 1:1–2:3 is\nalso a literal historical account . Whereas, few would disagree with the first two\ncharacteristics mentioned above, the stumbling block for many is to accept this\ntext as historical narrative, which therefore speaks authoritatively about the origin\nof the universe, life, and man and about the age of the earth.\nIt should be obvious to modern readers (just as it was to its original read-\ners) that this text should be approached mindful of this third characteristic. But\nunfortunately, to many it is not. Hence, the bulk of this chapter ( Section 2.1\nbelow) will be devoted to proving — by means of statistical, literary, and theo-\nlogical arguments — what would have been axiomatic to its original readers:\nthis text is a literal historical account. In addition, there is a need to demonstrate\nthat reading this text as a literal historical account leads to the conclusion that\nthe earth is thousands . . . not billions of years old.\n1.1 The Implications of Genre\nTwo principal genres have been proposed for this text: extended poetic metaphor\nand narrative. If this text is poetic metaphor, what are the implications for determin-\ning the age of the earth? On the other hand, what are they if it is narrative?\n13 . From Saint-Beuve’s essay, “What is a Classic?” (translated by Elizabeth Lee) in J. Smith\nand E. Parks, The Great Critics: An Anthology of Literary Criticism (New York: Norton,\n1967), p. 596–599.\n14 . Longinus’s essay “On the Sublime,” is discussed in J. Smith and E. Parks, The Great\nCritics, p. 62–63.\n",

A meta-\nphor has two parts: the vehicle, the actual words of the metaphor, and the tenor ,\nthe meaning of the words. 15 The tenor is derived by exploring the similarities and\ndifferences between the words of the metaphor. For example, consider Exodus\n15:8a: “By the breath of your nostrils the waters heaped up.” 16 The reference to\nGod’s nose is anthropomorphic language — God does not have a nose, for, as the\nScriptures teach, He is a spiritual being, not a material being (John 4:24). The\npresence of such clearly figurative language signals metaphor. So, “nose” does not\nrefer to a literal nose in this verse. Similarly, the phrase “the Lord is my rock”\nprompts the question: in what sense is the Lord like a rock? 17 And, conversely,\nin what sense is He not?\nIn metaphor, words do not have their normal range of meaning; instead,\nthe meaning of individual words is controlled by the metaphor. The individual\nwords of the vehicle do not have a one-to-one correspondence to people, things,\nstates, and actions in the world. So if the text is poetic metaphor, the real life\nreferents of the words in the text and the sequence of events portrayed by them\nis not the meaning of the text. That is to say the words do not tell us what really\nhappened. But scientists can only work with observable, measurable reality. So\nif the text is poetic metaphor, it has nothing to say about scientific theories of\norigins and therefore nothing about the age of the earth.\nOn the other hand, if the text is narrative, it could have much to say about\norigins and the age of the earth. It depends on the intent of the author. 18 Did\n15 .\t NPEPP , s.v. “metaphor.”\n16 . Unless indicated otherwise, Scripture quotes are my translations.\n17 . Below, I will follow the usual convention, translating YHWH (the covenant name of\nGod, which testifies to His self-existence) as “Lord,” but Adonai (meaning “master”)\nas “Lord.” Outside of translation, I will use “Lord.”\n18 . Wimsatt and Beardsley stated in their classic essay “The Intentional Fallacy”: “The\ndesign or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for\njudging the success of a work of literary art” (W.K. Wimsatt and M.C. Beardsley, “The\nIntentional Fallacy,” in ed. D. Newton-De Molina, On Literary Intention: Critical Essays ,\np. 1–13 [Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1976], p. 1). In their essay (originally\npublished in Sewanee Review 54 [summer 1946]) they argued that we cannot know\nan author’s intent, because it was in the mind of the author, a place inaccessible to us.\nWimsatt emended this quote to “The design or intention of the author is neither avail-\nable nor desirable as a standard for judging either the meaning or the success of a work\nof literary art” in his essay “Genesis: A Fallacy Revisited,” in Newton-De Molina, p.\n136 [emphasis mine]. The original essay, Wimsatt’s second essay, Hirsch’s rejoinders and\nclarifications on both sides during the heat of the debate are in Newton-De Molina’s\nanthology. More recently, Patterson traces the issues in the debate among literary\ntheorists, starting with Wimsatt and Beardsley’s seminal essay, continuing with Hirsch’s\ninsistence on authorial intention and determinancy of meaning, interacting with the\ndeconstructional hermeneutics of Derrida and Foucault and concluding with the ad-\nmission of de Man that the deconstructive impulse is dependent on the preexistence\nof a certain kind of reading (Annabel Patterson, “Intention,” in CTLS , p. 140–146).\n",

The man we honor\nthrough this publication has been a pioneer in this effort and has labored tirelessly\nto convince the Church of the importance of the early chapters of the Bible. The\nwarning to the Church is clear. A largely immoral and godless society is stark\ntestimony to the effect that embracing evolution has on a people.\nOthers have picked up the gauntlet — most recently, the RATE Group. 20\nAnd the third reason for this issue’s prominent currency is that the philo-\nsophical idea that the text is not admissible as evidence in the creation-evolution\ndebate is being challenged as arbitrary and presumptuous. The biblical evidence\nhas been barred or belittled based on two unproven suppositions connected\nwith the relationship between text and empirical evidence. The first is that the\ntextual evidence is inferior to physical evidence. And the second supposition is\n19 . The history of the Church’s thinking on this issue, discussed in chapters 1, 2, and 3 of\nthis volume, shows this to be the case.\n20 . The RATE Group engaged in the following pioneering research on radioisotope dat-\ning. Austin and Snelling applied all four long-age radioisotope dating methods to the\nsame rock unit. Snelling also exhaustively studied polonium radiohalos in biotite in\ngranodiorite and fission tracks in volcanic tuff. Humphreys developed an alternative\ngeochronometer from a previously ignored by-product of radioactive decay, helium,\nby measuring the helium “leak rate” as a function of temperature. Baumgardner ap-\nplied carbon-14 dating techniques to diamonds. Chaffin developed new nuclear decay\nmodels to account for accelerated decay. The results of their experimental, field, and\ntheoretical research are dumbfounding. They found that a previously unknown phe-\nnomenon, accelerated decay of radioactive isotopes, occurred in the past. This means\nthat the age of a rock cannot be derived from radioisotope dating methods. Moreover,\nthe presence of helium in zircon crystals, radiohalos from short-half-lived polonium in\nbiotite, and carbon-14 in diamonds prove that the earth is thousands, not billions, of\nyears old. For the technical discussions of the RATE scientists’ projects and findings see\ntheir chapters in RATE II. For a technical summary of the RATE Group’s findings, see\nVardiman’s concluding chapter in RATE II , p. 735–772.

Consequently, this invalidates the first\nsupposition.\nThis account of the relocation of 24 stones is noteworthy. After the nation\nhad crossed the dry riverbed of what had been the roiling Jordan at flood-stage\nand while the priests were still standing in the middle of it, carrying the ark of\nthe covenant, Joshua ordered at God’s behest that stones be placed as memorials\nto the miraculous parting of the river, which reprised the crossing of the Red Sea\na generation before. Twelve men, one from each tribe, were to take stones from\nthe midst of the Jordan riverbed and place them on its western bank. In addition,\nthey were to carry stones from the western bank and pile them in the riverbed at\nthe very spot where the priests were standing. And finally, in a frame-break (an\nauthor’s direct address to his contemporary readers) Joshua told his readers that\nthe stones were still there — a claim they easily could confirm or confute.\nWhat was the purpose for these two piles of stones?

And these stones will become a memorial to\nthe Israelites in perpetuity” (Josh. 4:6–7).\nThis brings out the point alluded to above: the divine interpretation is neces-\nsary to understand the meaning of the physical evidence.\nThe stones provided a durable memorial, which theoretically could have\nlasted forever, provided they were not moved. Yet, the Lord commanded that\nthe significance of the memorials was to be conveyed to subsequent generations\nwhen (not if) they asked the question, “What do these stones mean?” In fact,\nthey would be perpetual signs and memorials.

The Inevitable Result of Anti-Supernatural\nPresuppositions\nThe second supposition is that an anti-supernatural bias allows for an ob-\njective evaluation of the evidence, which will lead us to the truth. But 2 Kings\n6:8–12 shows us that just the opposite is the case: such a bias will mislead the\nseeker of truth!\nAccording to the text, Ben Hadad, the king of Aram, held secret strategy\nmeetings with his generals to set ambushes against the army of Israel. Likely,\nhe was attempting to kill or capture Joram, the king of Israel at that time. But\nhis every attempt at ambushing the army of Israel was thwarted by Elisha, who\nhaving been informed by the Lord about the location of the ambush, warned\nJoram. The latter sent scouts each time to confirm that an ambush had been set\nat the location told to him by the prophet. The king of Aram was completely\nfrustrated and drew the conclusion that anyone would draw if the possibility of\nsupernatural intervention is not even entertained : one of his men was a spy for the\nking of Israel! How else could the king of Israel know the location of his camp?\nGathering his highest officials together and not knowing the identity of the\nputative traitor and assuming that he could not have acted alone or at least not\nwithout the knowledge of the others, he effectively and collectively accused them\nall of treason, hoping no doubt that one of his officials would break and divulge\nthe identity of the turncoat in order to mitigate his own punishment. One of his\nofficials did speak up, but not to unmask a betrayer. Rather, he wanted to quickly\ndisabuse the king of his line of reasoning, to correct the king, a thing normally\nnot done. But the situation was not normal. This was no time for the usual\nsycophantic prattle to the king. The king was looking for a scapegoat to assuage\nhis fury. So the man blurted out to the king, to which he immediately appended,\n“My lord, the king,” to lessen the audacity of his outburst. He was saying in es-\nsence, “Your assessment of this situation is wrong, O my lord, the king. There is\nsomething going on here that you have not considered: a prophet of Israel can\ntell the king of Israel what you say in your most private moments!” Ben Hadad’s\nblind rage then turned toward Elisha, whom God protected in an extraordinary\nway, dispatching a heavenly army to surround the army of Aram.\nConsequently, Ben Hadad’s initial interpretation of the evidence, as he saw\nit, was completely wrong, because a priori he had excluded any supernatural\nexplanation for what he was observing. And so it is with all anti-supernatural\nbias: it leads to faulty, rather than accurate, interpretation of the evidence.\nHaving employed the Scriptures to dispense with these suppositions, we\nnow turn to examine the genre of the creation account.\n2.

I conclude\ntherefore that it is statistically indefensible to argue that this text is poetry . 35\nHaving proven that the Genesis text is certainly narrative, we now turn to\nexamine the implications of that finding. And in order to understand the inten-\ntion of the author of this text with regards to his narrative, we will look at the\nperspective biblical authors at large had toward the events to which they refer\nin their narratives.\n2.1.2 Literary Argument\nIn RATE chapter I adduce 15 proofs that authors of biblical narratives\nconsidered that their narratives referred to real events. 36 But below I will sketch\nonly ten: (1) customs are elucidated, (2) ancient names and current sayings\nare traced back to their origins, (3) monuments and pronouncements are as-\nsigned a concrete reason as well as a slot in history, (4) historical footnotes are\nsprinkled throughout the text, (5) written records used as sources are cited, (6)\nprecise chronological reference points are supplied, (7) genealogies are given,\n(8) prophetic utterances are recalled and related to events in the narrative, (9)\n“time words” invite ancient readers to validate historical claims made in the text,\nand (10) historical “trajectories” link different portions of the text and widely\nseparate historical periods. 37\n(1) Customs are elucidated. 38 Authors would have had little reason to\nof the classification accuracy ( RATE chapter, p. 669–674).\n35 . See the conclusions of the statistical study in RATE chapter, p. 675–676.\n36 . The complete list in RATE chapter is: (1) God’s people are defined in terms of their\npast; (2) God’s people are commanded to keep the memory of their past alive; (2)\nGod’s people engage in retrospection on their past; (4) the remembrance of the past\ndevolves on the present and determines the future; (5) customs are elucidated; (6)\nancient names and current sayings are traced back to their origins; (7) monuments and\npronouncements are assigned a concrete reason as well as a slot in history; (8) histori-\ncal footnotes are sprinkled throughout the text; (9) written records used as sources are\ncited; (10) precise chronological reference points are supplied; (11) genealogies are\ngiven; (12) observations of cultic days and seasons are called acts of commemoration;\n(13) prophetic utterances are recalled and related to events in the narrative; (14) “time\nwords” challenge ancient readers to validate historical claims made in the text; and (15)\nhistorical “trajectories” link different portions of the text and widely separate historical\nperiods.

As a first ex-\nample, consider the explanation given for a dietary exclusion: it was originated\nto memorialize when God dislocated Jacob’s hip with a touch while they wrestled\n(Gen. 32:26, 32–33).\nA second elucidated custom involved the removal of a sandal, which signi-\nfied that a kinsman redeemer had refused to engage in levirate marriage, that is,\na brother’s duty to raise up children for his heirless, deceased brother, by marry-\ning his widow (Deut. 25:5–10). In Ruth 4:7, the author explains this custom,\nwhich the author thought might not have been familiar to the reader. The custom\nis introduced with the phrase, “This was (the way) formerly in Israel concern-\ning redemption and exchange, to confirm any word: a man would draw off his\nsandal.” The word “formerly” suggests that the custom was not practiced in the\nauthor’s day — a fact that the author deemed important for his readers to know\n(Ruth 4:8). 39\nThe third custom is discussed in 1 Samuel 30. Upon returning to Ziklag,\nDavid discovered that a band of Amalekites had raided and kidnapped his family.\nHe and his six hundred men immediately set off after the criminals. Arriving at\nthe Wadi Besor, two hundred of his men were too exhausted to continue on. Four\nhundred continued with David. After slaughtering all but four hundred of the\nAmalekites (who had escaped on camels) and rescuing his family, David returned\nto the two hundred who had remained behind and shared the booty with them\nagainst the protests of some of the four hundred. The author of the text offered this\naccount in part to explain that the custom, that those who stayed with the supplies\nwould receive the same portion of the booty as those who fought in the battle,\noriginated in an order from David, issued at that time (1 Sam. 30:24–25).\n(2) Ancient names and current sayings are traced back to their origins.\nA biblical author frequently explained how a place received its name by appeal-\ning to the historical context in which the naming occurred. Often this name\npersisted in the author’s day. It is clear that the author expected his readers would\nbe interested in the explanation of the origin of names current in their day. Also,\nhistorical tracings of the origins of sayings are attested in many passages. 40\n(3)\t Monuments and pronouncements are assigned a concrete reason as\nwell as a slot in history. 41 Biblical authors frequently explained the purposes for\nthe placement of monuments, which often involved the naming of these monu-\nments. Four of these stand out. First, there is the dual naming of Gilead. Laban\ngave it an Aramaic name; Jacob, its Hebrew name (Gen. 31:44–54). Second,\n39 . See proof (9) below for further discussion on authorial claims of discontinuity, such\nas this.\n40 . A few passages proving this point are Genesis 4:17; Numbers 11:4–34; Deuteronomy\n3:14; Joshua 7:26; Judges 1:26; 2 Samuel 6:8; 1 Kings 9:13; 2 Kings 14:7; and 1\nChronicles 13:11. For many more examples and a thorough discussion of this point\nsee RATE chapter, p. 682 and 705–706 (Table D2).\n41 . An expansion on the following discussion and more examples of narrative texts exhibit-\ning this characteristic are in RATE chapter, p. 682–684.\n",

Three examples of this will suffice. The first concerns Israel; the other two\ndo not, and, in fact, take place outside of the land of Israel. All three accounts\nmove us to ask the question how did the author know this? The first, although\nit involves Israel, is about a non-Israelite, Rahab. The author anticipated and\nsupplied the answer to the question: how did a non-Israelite former prostitute\nend up living in their midst (Josh. 6:25)?\nThe second story explains why the lands and crops of the Egyptian people\nand the people themselves belonged to Pharaoh in the author’s day, but the priests\nwere not so subjected (Gen. 47:13–22).\nThe third story recounts how the Lord degraded, defeated, and destroyed\nDagon after the Philistines defeated Israel at the Battle of Aphek. They captured\nthe ark of the covenant, brought it to Ashdod, and inferring that Israel’s humili-\nation implied that Dagon had defeated the Lord, positioned the ark next to the\nstatue of Dagon to proclaim his victory.

One example from the first category is the\ninformation recorded in Deuteronomy 2:10–11: the name which the Moabites\ncalled the former inhabitants of their land. An example from the second category\nis that Hebron was formerly called Qiryat Arba (Josh. 14:15; Judg. 1:10).

Taking these in turn and offering one\nexample of each, genealogies (such as Gen. 4) furnish a type of historical record\nfor a given a historical period. Sometimes no events are recorded. In these cases\nthey therefore provide the actual structure of history. Moreover, when long peri-\nods of time are to be covered (such as in 1 Chron. 1–9), genealogies can survey\nhistory.

When reporting declarations\nabout the future, the biblical authors often explicitly linked prophetic statements\nto particular contexts.

We will look at four: three cursorily; one in detail.\nThe first three are these. Joshua had cursed anyone who would rebuild Jeri-\ncho (Josh. 6:26) and the fulfillment was announced after the death of the sons\nof Hiel, who rebuilt Jericho (1 Kings 16:34). The second is a prophet’s decree\nthat Eli’s line would be removed from the priesthood (1 Sam. 2:31) with the\nfulfillment announced after the banishment of Abiathar (1 Kings 2:27). Third,\nDaniel prayed that the Lord would repatriate the nation (Dan. 9:2–19), because\nhe recalled that Jeremiah had prophesied that the duration of the captivity would\nbe 70 years (Jer. 25:11–12).\nThe fourth example is the link between the prophecy concerning Josiah and\nits fulfillment. This was fully developed by the author in 1 Kings. Not only did\nthe narrator point out the connection between prophecy and fulfillment, as in\nthe first two examples above, but also one of the characters in the story makes\nthe observation. So an unnamed man of God cursed the altar at Bethel, which\nJeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, was consecrating.\nHe said: “O Altar, O Altar, thus the Lord says, ‘Indeed a son will be born to the\nHouse of David — Josiah, his name — and he will offer upon you the priests of\nthe high places, who burn sacrifices on you, and human bones will be burned\non you’” (1 Kings 13:2). Three hundred years later Josiah was not only zealously\nremoving the pagan altars and high places from his kingdom, but also desecrating\nthem (2 Kings 23). At Bethel, he ordered that bones from the tombs be burned\non the altar. The author of 2 Kings comments: “So he defiled it according to\nthe word of the Lord which the man of God, who had proclaimed these words,\nhad proclaimed” (2 Kings 23:16). Subsequently, when Josiah inquired about the\nidentity of a monument, the inhabitants of that city answered, “It is the tomb of\nthe man of God, who came from Judah. He proclaimed these things which you\nhave done against the altar at Bethel (verse 17).” Josiah, out of respect, ordered\nthat the bones of the man of God not be disturbed.\n(9) The use of “time words” to explicitly indicate testable temporal con-\ntinuity or discontinuity. Biblical authors could have told their stories without\nmaking any connections to their present. And thus their texts would only have\nbeen unverifiable tales — riveting, to be sure — but of little historical interest. 50\nBut they did just the opposite, anchoring their stories to testable and therefore\nfalsifiable claims. Indeed, their express statements linking the past to their pres-\nent or severing the present from the past was a risky business if they did not\n50 . This rubric militates against those biblical historians who maintain, as Ian Provan states,\nthat biblical narratives depict a “‘fictive world,’ entire in itself and referring only to\nitself. Its integrity must not be compromised by seeking to relate it to anything outside\nitself.” On the contrary, it is obvious that the author went out of his way to relate his\nhistory to his readers’ time by breaking away from his narrative and addressing his\nreaders directly (called “breaking frame”). Provan’s quote is cited by Michael Grisanti,\nBibSac 161 (April–June 2004): p. 167.\n",

In essence, they were challenging their contemporary readers\nto disprove their claims. 51\nTwo classes of temporal markers are attested which link at least two separate\ntimes, the author’s present and his past.

The most common of these is , ַעד  ַהּיוֹם  ַהֶּזה\n“until this day.” A special case of this class are those accounts which also include\nthe phrase “ , ְל ִמיּ M ם since the day,” or its equivalent, because it suggests an uninter-\nrupted continuity. The more common “until this day,” on the other hand, allows\nfor a break in continuity as long as it was reestablished by the author’s time. As\na result, the special case would be “easier” for a reader, who was a contemporary\nof the author, to falsify. The second group of time words marks discontinuity\nwith the past. The most important word in this class is “ , ִ ְל ָפ ִנים formerly.” We\nwill look at these in turn below.\nOur first examples from the continuity class are remarkable statements\nin which Moses claimed knowledge of Egyptian history. Commenting on the\nunprecedented phenomenon of the fiery hail to come, Moses said, “There has\nnot been like it in Egypt since it was founded until now” (Exod. 9:18). And\nin describing the severity of the locust plague to come, Moses said, “. . . which\nneither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen since they were upon the\nland (of Egypt) until this day” (10:6).\nThe following are three more from the Book of Joshua, in which he noted\nsituations that obtained during his time, the truth of which could have been easily\ntested: Ai was still in ruins after Joshua destroyed it (Josh. 8:28); the corpse of\nits king was still buried under the same pile of rocks, which Joshua had heaped\non him (8:29); and the Hivites who lived in Gibeon, who through a clever (and\ndesperate) ruse, had duped Joshua into making a covenant with them, were still\na servant class of “hewers of wood” and “drawers of water” in Israel (9:27).\nThe author(s) of the Books of Samuel also made additional historically verifi-\nable statements about his (their) day: the deposition of the ark of the covenant\n(1 Sam. 6:18) and Ziklag still belonged to the kings of Judah (27:6).\nTurning to the Book of Kings we discover more of the same type of claims\n— some of them quite interesting. The ark was placed in the temple, with its\nlong axis in line with that of the temple’s long axis (1 Kings 8:8). Solomon had\nincorporated all foreign enclaves into a greater Israel (9:20–21). Israel had seceded\nfrom Judah, forming the northern kingdom of Israel (12:19). Water, which had\nbeen miraculously purified by Elisha, was still potable (2 Kings 2:22). Moab had\n51 . Sternberg comments: “Whatever the truth value of the references and explanations\nmade, their very making strengthens the truth claim by anchoring the discourse in\npublic and accessible features of reality. ‘You see how the traces of time within our\nobservation make perfect sense within our account of time,’ the narrator seems to be\nsaying to his audience. . . . the present witnesses lend an air of truth to the evocation\nof the past from which they issued” (Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative, p.\n31–32).\n,\n-\n",

This is perhaps the most interesting charac-\nteristic of the Old Testament’s historiographic presentation. I call this category\nhistorical trajectories , because certain people, statements, and ideas were projected\nwith such great force in the first five books of the Bible that their trace is found\nthrough large expanses of text and time. Outside of the obvious promises made\nto the patriarchs are the not so obvious — but very important — trajectory of\nJoseph’s bones, the enigma of Balaam, the Lord’s dogged pursuit of the Amale-\nkites, 54 and the checkered history of Moab and Ammon. We will only look at\nthe first and last of these, beginning at the deathbed of Joseph.\nRecognizing that he was to die soon, Joseph asserted that God would inter-\nvene on their behalf and bring them up from Egypt and into the land, which\nHe swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob (Gen. 50:24). Moreover, repeating\nhis assertion and even strengthening it (“God will surely intervene”) in an act\nof faith reminiscent of his father’s, Joseph charged his family to not leave his\nbones in Egypt (Gen. 50:25). But Genesis ends with Joseph embalmed in a\nsarcophagus in Egypt.\nWe do not hear again the slightest rattle of these bones until suddenly they\nare clanking quite loudly at the Exodus: “Moses took the bones of Joseph with\n52 . The only difference of the Hebrew names for the Arameans and the Edomites is ( ד daleth )\nversus ( ר resh ). In the history of the Hebrew language — and evidenced in the preceding\nsentence in this note — the shape of daleth has closely resembled (and in some cases\nbeen identical to) the shape of resh in all periods (cf. Ada Yardeni, The Book of Hebrew\nScript: History, Paleography, Script Syles, Caligraphy and Design [London: The British\nLibrary and New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 2002], p. 2, figure 1). Paleographical\nconsiderations cannot resolve the textual problem. Nevertheless, “Edomites” — rather\nthan “Arameans” — is the preferred reading based upon the context, since the author\ndescribed Tiglath Pileser III’s destruction of Aram in the next paragraph in the text.\n53 . Examples of the second class are Deuteronomy 2:10, 12, 20; Joshua 11:10, 14:15,\n15:15; Judges 1:10–11, 23, 3:2; Ruth 4:7; 1 Samuel 9:9; 1 Chronicles 4:40, 9:20;\n2 Chronicles 9:11; and Nehemiah 13:5. For more examples of the first class and a\nthorough discussion of this point see RATE chapter, p. 686 and 712 (Table D8).\n54 .

The burial of Joseph’s\nbones, a historical closure, completed an inclusio 55 in the narrative. That is, Jo-\nseph was the first son of Jacob to leave the land and with his burial he was the\nfinal son to return.\nFor a second example, we will trace back to the patriarchal period the check-\nered history of Moab and Ammon. What is most significant about this trajectory\nis the way in which later texts refer to incidents reported in earlier texts, forming\nthe links of a chain that goes back to the origin of these peoples. The author of\nChronicles has the latest mention of Moab and the sons of Ammon. He looks back\nto the time in which Jehoshaphat — pleading for the Lord to deliver Judah from\nan invading horde which included Moabites and Ammonites, made the following\nbiting observation: “So now as far as the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir\nare concerned, among whom you would not allow Israel to enter, when they came\nfrom Egypt, with the result that they turned aside from them and did not destroy\nthem, they would recompense us by coming and driving us from your possession,\nwhich you caused us to possess” (2 Chron. 20:10–12). The original records of these\ndivine prohibitions are found in Deuteronomy 2:9 and 19. Concerning Moab, the\nLord said, “Do not harm Moab and do not stir up strife for battle against them,\nbecause I have not given you any of his land as a possession; because to the sons of\nLot I have given Ar as a possession (2:9).” The Lord’s prohibition regarding Ammon\nis almost identical (2:19). These texts look back to the time just before the chil-\ndren of Israel arrived at the plains of Moab. They had just defeated the Canaanites\nand Amalekites at Hormah. Fresh from this victory and perhaps wanting more,\nIsrael was eager to fight the Moabites and Ammonites, but the Lord forbad it. In\nexplaining to them His reasons for this prohibition, He affirmed that they were\nsons of Lot. This of course takes us back to the story about Lot and his daughters\ntold in Genesis 19. His daughters made Lot drunk on two successive nights. In his\ninebriated state he impregnated each of his daughters. Their sons by their father\nwere the progenitors of the Moabites and the Ammonites.\nThe chain is complete. It extends back from the days of the author of Chron-\nicles to the time of Jehoshaphat; from his time to the days before the Conquest;\nfrom the days before the Conquest to the patriarchal period.\nThe statistical study described above (section 2.1.1) established by math-\nematical rigor that Genesis 1:1–2:3 is narrative, not poetry. The just-concluded\n55 .\t Inclusio is a literary device whereby a section of Scripture (whether a few verses or many\nchapters) is framed by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section.\n",

Should we as readers believe what\nthe authors wrote? If we are faithful to their presentation, we should. These his-\ntorians do not allow us to be dispassionate observers of the past as we read their\ntexts. They compel us to believe the past they portray. But will we believe what\nGenesis 1:1–2:3 then is clearly saying?\nSternberg forcefully argues:\nWere the narrative written or read as fiction, then God would turn\nfrom the lord of history into a creature of the imagination, with the most\ndisastrous results. The shape of time, the rationale of monotheism, the\nfoundations of conduct, the national sense of identity, the very right to\nthe land of Israel, and the hope of deliverance to come: all hang in the\ngeneric balance. Hence, the Bible’s determination to sanctify and compel\nliteral belief in the past. It claims not just the status of history but . . . of\nthe history, the one and only truth that, like God himself, brooks no rival\n. . . .if as seekers for the truth, professional or amateur, we can take or leave\nthe truth claim of inspiration, then as readers we must simply take it — just\nlike any other biblical premise or convention, from the existence of God\nto the sense borne by specific words — or else invent our own text . 57\nWill we believe this text? Sternberg’s words should challenge us as Christians\nto see that this text is meant to be read as a historical narrative. That was the intent\nof its human author, who carried out the intent of its divine Author. To read it\nany other way is to read it against His intent. So, to return to the question, will\nwe believe this text? If we are faithful followers of Christ, we must. 58\n2.2 Magisterial Literary Composition\nHow does the text’s magisterial literary composition interact with its\nproven historical literalness to inform our understanding of the text? It does\nso in at least two ways. First, our understanding must be informed by the\nrealization that the author also wrote from a divine perspective, writing about\n56 .\t RATE chapter ,p. 690–691.

Nevertheless,\nour starting point must be the understanding of the first readers.\nThe procedure an author followed to write his text can be pictured as in\nfigure 1. The author looked first at an event (1) and then at his original readers\n(2) in order to produce his text (3). 60\nObviously, texts mean what words mean, but words mean what the original\nreaders would have thought them to mean. 61 This is particularly the case with\nhistorical narratives. 62 Our consideration of these readers constrains us to ap-\nproach the text cognizant of two\ncaveats. The first is that the original\nreaders were not scientists. The\nauthor therefore did not write a sci-\nence textbook. And we should not\napproach it as a science textbook.\nWhat this means is that we should\nnot expect it to have the wording\nof a so-called “precise” scientific\ndescription.\nThe second caveat is that it\nwas originally written to a 15th-\ncentury B.C. audience, whose\nperception of the world was limited\nto their five senses.

For more discussion on the hermeneutical significance of the relationship of author to\nreaders, see RATE chapter, p. 639–641 figure 1.\n61 . Although it is possible that we would understand the text better than the original\nreaders, it is improbable, because unless later Old Testament texts or New Testament\ntexts elucidate the text in question — all other things being equal — they knew the\nlanguage and culture of their day better than we. And in light of this they should be\nour guide.\n62 . In historical narrative there is much less linguistic latitude than in poetic prophetic\npassages, which are frequently metaphorical, and thus more difficult to understand.

Both of\nthese are phenomenological language.\n2.2.2 Descriptions of the Rock Hyrax\nFor a second example, we turn from astrophysics to zoology. According to\nLeviticus 11:5–6 and Deuteronomy 14:7, hyraxes were excluded from the ancient\nIsraelite diet because they chew the cud 65 but do not have split hooves. But as\na matter of fact, they are not true ruminants. 66 They do not regularly bring up\npartially digested food and re-chew it. Nevertheless, zoologists have observed\nthem chewing some distance away from their browsing area. 67 But these scientists\nare equivocal on the reason for this chewing. Rahm says the animals ruminate. 68\nWhat he means by this is unclear, since they do not have multiple stomachs.\n63 . Thus, for example, in Genesis 1:16–17 the Hebrew verbs “( עׂשה make, do, perform”)\nand “( נתן give, place, allow”) mean “make” and “place,” respectively, in context.\n64 .

For a defense of the identification\nof the šāpān as the rock hyrax, see Nosson Slifkin, The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax: A\nStudy of The Laws of Animals with One Kosher Sign in Light of Modern Zoology (Nanuet,\nNY: Targum Press, 2004), 99–105.

In short, because they\nappear to ruminate (or might actually ruminate) and do not have split hooves\nthey were considered ceremonially impure.\n2.3 Foundational Theological Treatise\nAnd finally, we must understand that Genesis 1:1–2:3 is a foundational\ntheological treatise . 74 Commonly, scholars compare Genesis 1:1–2:3 with ancient\n69 .

The digestive system of the hyrax is complex and almost unique among mammals,\nhaving three separate areas for food fermentation: the fore-stomach, the caecum, and\nthe paired colonic appendages (Ibid., p. 115–117, in particular the drawing on page\n116; and Hoeck). The additional chambers slow down the digestive process and culture\nbacteria, both necessary to digest cellulose (Dennis Englin [Professor of Biological Sci-\nences at The Master’s College], personal communication). Recent studies have concluded\nthat the hyrax digests cellulose as well as a ruminant (Johan J.C. Sauer, “The Efficiency\nof Crude Fiber Digestion in the Hyrax Procavia Capensis” [Ph.D. diss., University of\nPretoria (South Africa), 1987], Abstract in proquest.umi.com; J.R.

A behavior in which the animal regurgitates a little food and re-chews it, but it does\nnot play as significant a role in digestion as it does with ruminants (Slifkin, The Camel,\nthe Hare and the Hyrax, p. 110–111).\n73 . Photographs of their feet are in Slifkin, The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax, p. 106.\nZoologists originally classified them as Ungulata , “hooved,” but since have changed\ntheir taxonomy to superorder Paenungulata , “near ungulates” (Rahm, Grzimek’s Animal\nLife Encyclopedia , Vol. 12, s.v. “hyraxes” p. 513).\n74 . This is one of the most profoundly theological texts in the Bible, in that the Hebrew\nword for God,  , ל ֱאֹלהים occurs 35 times. In biblical Hebrew, normally, when a sentence\ncontinues the topic of the previous sentence, the topic is not relexicalized (repeated as\nthe subject) but carried by the pronominal clitics in the verb inflection.

Second, the Lord is uncreated; the ANE gods are created in some way.\nThird, the existence of the Lord is neither proved nor asserted but rather assumed;\nin the ANE texts the focus is on theogony (the origin of the gods). Fourth, the\nLord is separate from His creation; the ANE gods are deified natural forces. And\nfifth, the Lord is an unopposed sovereign Creator; the ANE texts feature battles\namong the gods, after which the victor creates. 78\nrelexicalization emphasizes the topic (its uniqueness, contrast with other possible topics,\netc.). But here we have a 35-fold relexicalization, an unprecedented and unmatched\nlevel of redundant relexicalization, to drive home the point that God is the Creator .\n75 . Most often the Babylonian accounts (both Enūma Elish and Atra- ‹ asīs ) are examined\nfor parallels. But John Currid looks at the Egyptian (John D. Currid, Ancient Egypt\nand the Old Testament [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1997], p. 53–73). So does\nGordon Johnston. He argues that Genesis 1 is an anti-Egyptian-cosmogony polemic,\nnoting both “striking similarities” and “dramatic differences” between Genesis 1 and\nthe Egyptian creation myths (Gordon H. Johnston, “Genesis 1 and Ancient Egyptian\nCreation Myths,” Bibliotheca Sacra 165 [April–June 2008]: p. 178–194, esp, 182–194).\nI will be mostly discussing the Babylonian material below, but the same arguments\napply to the Egyptian.\n76 . When the ANE creation and flood texts were unearthed, scholars noted the similarities\nbetween them and the biblical account. And so they began to read the Bible in light of\nthese “so-called” parallels. But an ancient reader would not have reacted this way to the\nbiblical texts in light of the ANE texts. The latter were familiar to them. Thus, what\nwould have stood out for them would have been the differences between the biblical\naccount and the ANE account. The author meant for the similarities to be an impetus\nto the reader to note the contrasts.\n77 . Also because of the wider purposes of the divine Author, the text functions as a polemic\nagainst all erroneous views, of our time as well as those of when it was written. Gordon\nWenham comments forcefully on the latter, “Gen. 1 is a deliberate statement of [the]\nHebrew view of creation over against rival views. It is not merely a demythologization\nof oriental creation myths, whether Babylonian or Egyptian; rather it is polemical\nrepudiation of such myths” (Gordon J. Wenham, Genesis 1–15, Word Biblical Com-\nmentary, vol. 1 [Waco, TX: Word Books, Publisher, 1987], p. 9).\n78 . For further details see Gerhard F.

(1) The\nLord created by fiat and unopposed actions; the ANE gods, by birth, battle, magic\nand opposed action. (2) The Lord created from no preexistent matter; the gods,\nfrom eternal matter or vanquished foes. 79 (3) The Lord created in a sequence of\ndays; the gods — there is no analogy. (4) The Lord purposefully progressed in His\ncreation toward the creation of man; the gods created man as an afterthought. (5)\nThe Lord created man deliberately and personally; the gods created man from the\nentrails of a vanquished foe, 80 because they needed someone to feed them (as in\nEnūma Elish ) or created him from one of the lower hierarchy of gods, 81 because\nthey needed someone to dig the canals (as in Atra- ‹ asīs ). (6) The Lord blessed\nman and placed him as vice-regent over the natural realm; the ANE texts have\nman subservient to the nature gods and terrified of them.\nThe third contrast is between the mythical ANE accounts and the patently\nanti-mythical character of Genesis 1:1–2:3. The latter is evidenced by its lack of\nstruggle or competing deities, the preexistence of the Creator rather than matter,\nthe distribution of ( ָּב ָרא bārā  , “create”) the mention of ( ְּתהֹום t  hôm ,\n“world ocean”) and the account of the fourth day. 82 I will explain the last three\nin order below.\nIn biblical Hebrew, the verb ( ָּבָרא create) always has God for its subject\nand never mentions the material from which He created. Its presence in a verse\ntherefore underscores that God is the Creator . With this emphasis, its occurrence\nin verses 1, 21, 27(3x) and 2:3 (elsewhere in Genesis 1, ‘ [ ָע ָׂשה āśāh , “make”]\nis used) is decidedly anti-mythical. In verse 1 it proves that God is the creator of\nmatter. This is in stark contrast to the pre-existence of matter in all the ANE texts.\nThe three-fold usage of ָּבָרא which makes verse 27 a poetic tricolon, drives\nhome the points that 1) God deliberately and purposeful created man to be His\nrepresentative, 2) he was the pinnacle of creation and 3) God created him to rule\nover the natural world. This differs altogether from the ANE myths, in which\nman is created as an afterthought and serves the nature deities. The occurrence\nof ָּבָרא in verse 21 shows that God created the gigantic sea creatures; they are\nnot gods and goddesses, as they are portrayed in the ANE myths. 83 Finally, in 2:3\nin an inclusio with 1:1 the presence of ָּבָרא confirms that God is the Creator\nof everything. Only He was pre-existent.\n79 . In Enūma Elish (a Babylonian creation myth) the victorious Marduk fashioned the\nuniverse by arching the exploded carcass of his nemesis, the monstrous serpent goddess\nTiamat .\n80 .\t Kingu , the monstrous serpent god, who was Tiamat’s henchman.\n81 .\t Ilu-wer\n82 . Sarna states, “The outstanding peculiarity of the biblical account is the complete absence\nof mythology in the classic pagan sense of the term” and “Nowhere is the non-myth o-\nlogical outlook better illustrated than in the Genesis narrative. The Hebrew account\nis matchless in its solemn and majestic simplicity” (Nahum M. Sarna, Understanding\nGenesis [New York: Schocken Books, 1966], p. 9–10).\n83 .

First, the sun and moon are not named to show\nthat they are not even sentient, let alone gods. The lack of both naming and\nblessing in these verses is striking, in that in the other days of creation week, the\nLord either named or blessed. 85 Second, this lack is almost awkward as the author\ncarefully avoids mentioning the common Hebrew (and Semitic) names for the\nsun and the moon, ( ֶׁש ֶמׁש šemeš , cf. its obvious phonetic equivalent to the\nBabylonian name for the sun god, Šamšu ) and   ( ָיֵר ַח Yārēa H ), respectively.\nYet, elsewhere there is no such reluctance (e.g., Ps. 121:6). Third, the complex\npalistrophic structure of the passage delimits their “rule” to serving man , by link-\ning verse 16b (“the great light for the ruling of the day and the small light for the\nruling of the night”) with verse 14b (“let them be for signs, for appointed times\nand for days and years). 86 This is diametrically opposed to the ANE concept of\n84 . See note 79 above.\n85 . On the first three days of creation week He named light, darkness, firmament, dry land,\nand the gathering of water, “day,” “night,” “heaven,” “earth” and “seas,” respectively.\nOn the last three days He blessed the sea creatures and flying animals, man, and the\nseventh day.\n86 . The palistrophic structure (corresponding clauses form an ABCDD´C´B´A´ or similar\npattern) in Genesis 1:14–19 comprises eleven purposes clauses a – k . Six (a , f and i – k)\nare construed by ל + infinitive construct of three different verbal roots: 1) “ להבדיל to\ndivide,” 2) “ להאיר to shine light” and 3) “ למׁשל to rule.” Three (b, c, and d) are in verse\n14b, “for signs, for appointed times, for days and years.” Two (g and h) are imbedded\nin verse 16, “the big light source for the ruling of the day and the small light source\nfor the ruling of the night.” “For ruling” in this verse is ,לממׁשלתwhich is  לplus a\nnoun from the verbal root of clause j (root 3). Finally, clause e , “for light sources,” is\nconnected to clause f , “to shine light on the earth,” and thus, corresponds semantically\nto the latter.\nThe clauses are arranged as follows: the last clause (k) clearly corresponds to the first\n(a) , because both have root 1 and they have semantically equivalent objects. We will\ncall them therefore a and a ´. Furthermore, the third (f) is identical to the third from\nlast (i) . So they are f and f ´. In addition, g and h are the same, enabling us to assign g\nto both. This leaves us b , c and d and j . The schema, then, is as follows: a [ b , c and d ]\nf g - g f ´ [ j ] a ´. That is, among the clauses corresponding to one another because they\nhave identical roots, the b , c and d grouping is between the first and second and j is\nbetween the last and the second to last. The result is that the precision of the author’s\nmeticulously crafted structure directs the reader to semantically equate b , c and d with\nj .

This text’s original readers would\nnever have thought it meant “age.”\nOther modern readings 88 are as much counter-readings 89 as the ANE creation\naccounts are.

The creation of the stars is presented as an afterthought, because the verb “make” (at\nthe beginning of the verse) is separated from its third direct object “the stars” by the\ninterposition of the description of the role of the great light and the small light. The\nverb is not repeated in spite of the length of the intervening phrase. An interpretive\ntranslation would be “He made (the great light with a certain role and the small light\nwith a certain role) and the stars.”\n88 . For a discussion of objections to an historical reading of this text and answers to these,\nsee RATE chapter, p. 635–639.\n89 . In a narrow sense, a “counter-reading” is any incorrect interpretation of a text, and is\na reading therefore against the author’s intent. Such a reading will be assured by not\nreading a text according to its genre. Reading Genesis 1:1–2:3 incorrectly as poetry\nrather than as narrative is an example. But, in a wider sense, a counter-reading is also\na counter-reading of reality. Asserting the big-bang theory or macro-evolution against\nthe literal historical account of this great text is as much a counter-reading as the bizarre\n“reality” portrayed in the ANE texts.

Box 510, Hebron, Kentucky 41048 dfaulkner@answersingenesis.org\nABSTRACT\nFor too long, recent creationists have dismissed the existence of dark matter and dark energy as rescuing devices for the big\nbang model. A proper survey of the history of both dark matter and dark energy reveals that this assessment of dark matter and\ndark energy is false. There are three robust lines of evidence for dark matter, two of which were known long before the big bang\nmodel became widely accepted. If the big bang model were to fall out of favor, the reality of dark matter would remain. Thus,\nthe existence of dark matter has nothing to do with the big bang model. Dark matter easily can be included within a recent cre­\nation model, so I discourage recent creationists from rejecting the dark matter hypothesis in an attempt to nullify the big bang\nmodel. The unexpected downturn in the Hubble relation at great distances is the evidence for dark energy, albeit interpreted in\nterms of the big bang model. What the downward inflection of the Hubble relation might mean in a biblical cosmology/cos­\nmogony is unknown, for no such model yet exists. In developing such models, I encourage recent creationists to consider the\nevidence generally interpreted in terms of dark matter and dark energy.\nKEYWORDS\nDark Matter, Dark Energy, Cosmology, Cosmogony\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSince the turn of this century, dark matter and dark energy have been\nwidely accepted in cosmological models. These models are based\nupon the big bang, the assumption that the universe suddenly ap­\npeared nearly 14 billion years ago in a very hot, dense, expanding\nstate. The big bang model further posits that as the universe expand­\ned and inevitably cooled, stars and structure (galaxies) arose, eventu­\nally resulting in the universe that we observe today. Since this mod­\nel contradicts many aspects of the Genesis creation account, recent\ncreationists reject the big bang model. Perhaps because of their close\nassociation with the big bang model, many creationists also reject\ndark matter and dark energy. However, is this rejection warranted?\nIn this paper, I will review the evidence for dark matter and dark\nenergy. I will demonstrate that the evidence for dark matter is very\nrobust, predating the wide acceptance of the big bang model by near­\nly 40 years. Hence, the evidence for dark matter has very little to do\nwith the big bang model, and I discourage recent creationists from\nrejecting the dark matter hypothesis as a strategy to nullify the big\nbang model. On the other hand, there is a much more intimate rela­\ntionship between dark energy and the big bang model. There are data\nthat when interpreted in terms of the big bang model leads to the con­\nclusion of dark energy. While we reject the big bang model, the data\nremain. Creationists need to address the question of what that same\ndata may mean within a truly biblically based cosmology.\nII. DARK MATTER\nThere are three independent lines of evidence for dark matter:\n1.\t Dispersion velocities of galaxy clusters\n2.\t Rotation curves of spiral galaxies\n3.\t Gravitational lensing of distant galaxies and quasars by closer\ngalaxy clusters\nAs I explained in an earlier paper (Faulkner 2017a), measurements of\nthe dispersion of velocities of galaxies in clusters was the first obser­\nvational evidence for dark matter, dating back 90 years ago (Zwicky\n1933, 1937c; Ostriker, 1999). Zwicky measured the Doppler veloc­\nities of galaxies in the Coma Cluster. Assuming that the measured\nDoppler motions of those galaxies were due to orbital motion of the\nmembers of the Coma Cluster, Zwicky used the virial theorem to cal­\nculate the dynamic mass , the amount of mass required to account for\nthe orbital motion. As explained below, astronomers already knew\nhow much mass was required to produce the light we receive from\ngalaxies. Therefore, from measurement of the brightness of galaxies\non photographs of the Coma Cluster, Zwicky was able to determine\nthe lighted mass of the Coma Cluster. Zwicky found that the dynamic\nmass of the Coma Cluster exceeded its lighted mass by two orders\nof magnitude. Adjustments in the cosmic distance scale since then\nhave reduced the mismatch to only a factor of 50. Meanwhile, Smith\n(1936) found a similar discrepancy between the dynamic mass and\nthe lighted mass of the Virgo cluster. Other clusters of galaxies show\n9th\n2023\n",

Inter­\nestingly, Kahn and Woltjer (1959) found that the mass required to\naccount for the mutual orbital motion of the Milky Way Galaxy and\nthe Andromeda Galaxy (M31) required six times the combined mass\nof the two galaxies. In his first paper (in German), Zwicky referred to\ndunkle materie , which translates into English as dark matter . How­\never, that term was not used by astronomers for decades. Instead,\nastronomers used the term missing mass . It was only since the 1980s\nthat astronomers changed back to Zwicky’s original term.\nSlusher (1974) was the first to mention in the creation literature the\ndiscrepancy between the dynamic and lighted masses of galaxy clus­\nters as a possible argument for recent origin (see p. 343 of Faulkner\n[2019] for other references of this in the creation literature). Slusher\nsaw this as evidence for recent origin. His reasoning was that since\nthe velocities of galaxies in clusters exceed the orbital velocities im­\nplied by the lighted masses of the clusters, the galaxies were not\norbiting. Rather, the motions of galaxy in clusters indicated that\nclusters are not gravitationally bound and thus are expanding. This\nexpansion could continue indefinitely, but it could not have been go­\ning on very long, much less than the supposed billions of year age\nof the universe. Bouw (1977a, 1977b) offered an early discussion\nin the creation literature of the velocities of galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster and recommended caution in using this argument based upon\nobservations that suggest that the observed motions of its members\nis orbital. This amounts to a conclusion that dark matter may be real.\nI have agreed with this assessment (Faulkner 1998, 2017a). The op­\nposition to dark matter that some recent creationists have may stem\nfrom a desire to maintain this argument for recent origin that Slusher\npioneered.\nThe second line of evidence for dark matter, the rotation curves of\nspiral galaxies, goes back nearly as far as Zwicky’s work with the\nComa Cluster. A century ago, astronomers began to measure the or­\nbital motion of objects within galaxies to determine the masses of\nthose galaxies. The nuclei of spiral galaxies account for much of the\nlight of those galaxies, and presumably much of their masses (more\nmass translates into more stars, which translates into more light).\nSpiral galaxies appear to be radially symmetric, suggesting the mass\ndistribution in spiral galaxies is also radially symmetric. When mass\nis distributed with radial symmetry, the only mass that affects an ob­\nject’s orbital velocity is that mass orbiting more closely to the center\nthan the object. Therefore, measuring the Doppler motion across the\nlong axis of a spiral galaxy acts as a probe of the mass distribution\nas a function of distance from the galaxy’s center. The summation\nof the mass distribution yields the total mass. A correction must be\napplied for how out of the line of sight the orbital motion is. For any\nspiral galaxy, this angle is easily determined by measuring the gal­\naxy’s major and minor axes in a photograph. Radial velocity studies\nof the nuclei of spiral galaxies showed a linear relationship between\norbital velocity and distance from the centers of those galaxies. If the\namount of light is directly proportional to mass, then this linear rela­\ntionship in the nuclei of galaxies is expected. Therefore, these studies\nconfirm the relationship between light and mass, what astronomers\ncall the mass to light ratio , at least in the nuclei of spiral galaxies.\nSince spectroscopy disperses light, it is a very inefficient use of light.\nA century ago, these studies required the largest telescopes that then\nexisted, with photography that was at best 1-2 percent efficient. This\nseverely limited how faint these studies could be conducted. There­\nfore, only the closest galaxies were sampled, and then only their nu­\nclear regions. This resulted in finding only the masses of the nuclei of\ngalaxies. But since the nuclei of spiral galaxies accounted for much\nof the light of the galaxies, masses measured this way were expected\nto be well within an order of magnitude of the entire masses of the\ngalaxies, probably within a factor of 2-3. It was these studies, along\nwith kinematic studies within our Milky Way Galaxy, that estab­\nlished the light to mass ratio that Zwicky used to establish the lighted\nmass of clusters of galaxies.\nWhat was the expected behavior of orbital motion outside of the nu­\nclei of spiral galaxies? Since the light outside the nuclei of galax­\nies abruptly decreases just outside the nuclei and then continues to\ngradually decreases with increasing distance, the mass distribution\nwas expected to similarly decline with increasing distance as well.\nWhen objects orbit a large, centrally located mass, orbital motion\nis inversely proportional to orbital distance. For instance, the sun\ncontains more than 99.8% of the solar system’s mass. Consequently,\nthe orbital speeds of planets are inversely proportional to their or­\nbital distances. Since this condition fits planetary motion well, and\nKepler’s laws describe planetary motion, then orbital velocity that is\ninversely proportional to orbital distance is called Keplerian . Since\nthere is light emanating beyond the nuclear regions of spiral galaxies,\nthe mass distribution beyond the nuclei is not zero, but it would be\nexpected to be much smaller than the mass in the nuclei. Hence, the\nexpected velocity function would be to begin to abruptly decrease\nbeyond the nuclei and approach Keplerian behavior (See Fig. 1).\nA century ago, the size of telescopes and the observational tech­\nniques then in use did not make it feasible to extend radial velocity\nstudies beyond the nuclei of spiral galaxies. At the edge of the nu­\nclei, the radial velocity curves appeared to turn over, suggesting that\nbeyond that point the radial velocities curves approached Keplerian\nbehavior, so there was no reason to pursue the radial velocity curves\nfarther out. Pushing the limits of what was technologically possible\nat the time, Babcock (1939) showed that the orbital velocities of a\nfew objects some distance from the nucleus of the Andromeda Gal­\naxy (M 31) were not Keplerian. Indeed, those objects had velocities\nthat were about as high as the turnover point. The following year,\nOort (1940) found similar anomalous results for the lenticular galaxy\nNGC 3115. He wrote that “the distribution of mass in the system\nappears to bear almost no relation to that of light.”\nAstronomers tended to ignore these anomalies for three decades.\nPerhaps it was because they didn’t know what to make of them.\nDuring these three decades, the masses of additional galaxies were\ndetermined by stopping at the turnover points on their radial velocity\ncurves, again assuming that those curves were Keplerian beyond the\nturnover points. For instance, as I have documented (Faulkner 2021),\nbetween 1959 and 1965 Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge and their\ncollaborators published more than two dozen papers applying this\ntechnique to various galaxies. The non-Keplerian nature beyond the\nturnover point was obvious in many of those radial velocity curves.\nHowever, the Burbidges ignored this and calculated galaxy masses\nfrom the portion of the radial velocity curves in the galaxy’s nuclei.\nSince the Burbidges were so respected by other astronomers, they\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n2\n",

About the time of this collaboration,\nRubin was first author on a paper that did not involve the Burbidges\nwhich examined motions of stars within the Milky Way (Rubin, et\nal. 1962). They found that “for R > 8.5 kpc, the stellar curve is flat,\nand does not decrease as is expected for Keplerian orbits.” This may\nhave been the first clear indication that a similar problem exists in the\nMilky Way Galaxy.\nAbout this time, Rubin met instrument maker Kent Ford, which a\nfew years later resulted in a decade-long collaboration extending ra­\ndial velocity curves of spiral galaxies. Ford combined image tubes,\nthe latest technology used in astronomy in the late 1960s, to boost\nthe sensitivity of cameras recording spectra. When combined with\nthe larger telescopes coming into use at that time (especially the two\n4-meter telescopes at the recently opened national optical observa­\ntories) allowed extending good observations over the supposed Ke­\nplerian part of galaxy radial velocity curves for the first time. Being\nthe closest and hence brightest spiral galaxy, M 31 was the first target\n(Rubin and Ford 1970), in which they confirmed Babcock’s earlier\nwork. It is worth noting that more than a decade earlier, a study of\n21-cm radiation of neutral hydrogen in M 31 showed the same thing\n(van de Hulst, et al. 1957; Schmidt 1957). Additionally, Roberts and\nWhitehurst (1975) extended the rotation curve of M31 beyond what\nRubin and Ford had. Roberts and Whitehurst found that the mass-to-\nlight ratio in the outermost regions of M31 had to be at least 200. Ru­\nbin and Ford spent the 1970s investigating the radial velocity curves\nof many spiral galaxies, culminating in 1980 (Rubin, et al. 1980).\nWhile Rubin was pursuing this work optically in the 1970s, radio\nastronomers were using 21-cm radiation to produce radial velocity\ncurves of galaxies that agreed with the visible light results of Rubin\nand Ford (Rogstad and Shostak 1972). By the 1980s, this ground­\nbreaking work began to convince most astronomers of the reality of\ndark matter. It was not until 1984 that Bond, et al. (1984) resurrected\nZwicky’s original term dark matter .\nIn the 1980s, cosmologists began to discuss dark matter within big\nbang models, though that discussion did not begin in earnest until the\n1990s. One would think that inclusion of dark matter in cosmologi­\ncal models would have been motivated by the desire to have realistic\nmodels. After all, if gravity is the dominant force in cosmology, and\nif gravity is caused by matter, then cosmological models that omit\n90% of the mass of the universe cannot be very good. However, this\ndoes not seem to have been the case. One reason why cosmologists\nbegan to include dark matter was to explain galaxy formation. The\ndensity of the universe in big bang models at the time could not ac­\ncount for galaxy formation. It was hoped that dark matter could help\nsolve this problem. Another reason dark matter was considered in\nFigure 1. A measured rotation curve of the galaxy M33 superimposed upon an image of the galaxy. The origin of the rotation curve is at the galaxy’s center.\nThe horizontal axis is distance from the galactic center, with radial velocity on the vertical axis. The dashed line is the rotation curve expected from the light\ndistribution, assuming that light and mass are directly related. Beyond the turnover around 9,000 light years from the galactic center, the expected curve\napproaches Keplerian. Contrast this with the observed orbital velocity consisting of yellow and blue data points fitted to the solid line.\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n3\n",

          "text_content": "cosmology was the desire to achieve critical density in a Friedmann\nuniverse. In a roundabout way, this addresses the need to have a more\nrealistic big bang model by considering all the matter in the universe.\nHowever, we don’t live in a Friedmann universe (dark energy is not\ncompatible with a Friedmann universe). Frankly, I never understood\nthis bias among cosmologists. Even before the discovery of dark en­\nergy, the assumption of a Friedmann universe seemed like an unnec­\nessary imposition. And even if we live in a Friedmann universe, why\nmust its density be critical? The density of the universe ought to be a\nmeasured quantity, not an assumed boundary condition.\nThe third line of evidence for dark matter is gravitational lensing. If a\nvery massive object is nearly in the line of sight of a much more dis­\ntant object, the strong gravity of the nearer object can distort space­\ntime so that the light of the more distant object is bent, resulting in an\naltered view of the more distant object. Since this bending is similar\nto the refraction of a lens, this phenomenon is called gravitational\nlensing. While there were several early publications suggesting the\npossibility of gravitational lensing, the phenomenon is most associ­\nated with Albert Einstein, who published a paper about it in 1936.\nThese early treatments were primarily theoretical. The first practi­\ncal discussion of gravitational lensing was the following year when\nZwicky (1937a, 1937b), proposed that clusters of galaxies could act\nas gravitational lenses of more distant galaxies.\nDepending upon the geometry, gravitational lensing can take several\nforms. One form of gravitational lensing is two or more images of\nthe same object. The first discovered gravitational lens was of this\ntype (Walsh, Carswell, and Weymann 1979). The twin quasar SBS\n0957+561 consists of two quasars separated by just six arcseconds\nand having the same redshift (z = 1.41) and nearly the same apparent\nmagnitude. On images of SBS 0957+561, the giant elliptical galaxy\nQ0957+561 G1 with redshift z = 0.355 is asymmetrically located\nbetween the twins. Since Q0957+561 G1 has a much smaller red­\nshift, it is presumed to be in the foreground of SBS 0957+561. The\nproximity of two quasars with similar spectra, identical redshifts,\nand nearly the same apparent magnitude suggested that they were\ntwo images of the same quasar. Confirmation came when identical\nvariations in brightness of the two quasars separated in time by 417\ndays were discovered. This is interpreted as a delay due to different\ntravel distances of light on two different paths caused by the galaxy\nQ0957+561 G1 not lying exactly along the line of site to the midway\nbetween quasar SBS 0957+561.\nThe more common situation is gravitational lensing of a distant gal­\naxy or galaxies by a nearer cluster of galaxies. One of the best ex­\namples of this is CL 0024+17 (aka ZwCl 0024+1652) (Anonymous,\nno date) (see Fig. 2). Most of the cluster members in this HST image\nof CL 0024+17 appear yellow. However, near the center of the clus­\nter there are a series of blue concentric arcs that are gravitationally\nlensed images of more distant galaxies. Modeling the observed lens­\ning allows determining the amount of mass required to produce the\nlensing, as well as the distribution of the mass (see Fig. 3). In every\ncase of gravitational lensing caused by clusters of galaxies, the total\ninferred mass exceeds the lighted mass by a factor of 5-10.\nIII. CREATIONISTS’ RESPONSES TO DARK MATTER\nThe concordance from the three lines of evidence for dark matter\non the amount of dark matter required to explain the observations is\nstriking. Under most circumstances, such concordance constitutes a\nstrong case, but astronomers were very reluctant to reach this conclu­\nFigure 2. A Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image of CL 0024+17.

Many creationists seem to be under\nthe illusion that astronomers and cosmologists rapidly incorporated\ndark matter into their models or that astronomers and cosmologists\nentirely made dark matter up to explain away problems with their\nevolutionary models. For instance, this quote by Hartnett (2014)\ndemonstrates this latter thinking:\n…we need to understand that dark matter , dark energy,\nand other “unknowns” … were only proposed in the stan­\ndard big bang cosmology to resolve some conflicts be­\ntween the standard paradigm and astrophysical obser­\nvations . [emphasis added]\nHowever, a frank assessment of the history of dark matter as outlined\nhere reveals that neither astronomers nor cosmologists were quick to\nembrace dark matter, nor that dark matter was invoked merely as a\nrescuing device for evolutionary ideas.\nThere are many examples of articles in the creation literature doubt­\ning the existence of dark matter ( e.g ., Dobberpuhl 2017; Hartnett\n2006, 2007, 2017; Hebert 2013). Some of this criticism of dark mat­\nter stems from reports of failure to detect dark matter more directly.\nTheoretical physicists have proposed several theories as to what dark\nmatter is made of. One promising candidate is weakly interacting\nmassive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs were thought to be new elemen­\ntary particles that interact only with gravity and possibly a hitherto\nunknown force. Most attempts to search for WIMPs focused on de­\ntection of products of WIMP annihilation, such as neutrinos, gamma\nrays, and cosmic rays. All these searches have been fruitless.\nAnother candidate for dark matter has been massive compact halo\nobjects (MACHOs). MACHOs would be normal matter in exotic\nforms, such as quiescent black holes and neutron stars. There have\nbeen tests of their existence by looking for gravitational lensing that\nmight happen as MACHOS pass in front of halo stars in the Milky\nWay. These searches have been fruitless too.\nAnother candidate has been axions, a potential particle conceived\napart from dark matter so was readily at hand. Axions were hypoth­\nesized to explain the preservation of charge conjugation symmetry\nand parity symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Like the other\ncandidates, axions have yet to be detected. Sterile neutrinos would\ninteract via gravity but no other force. There are good reasons to\nthink sterile neutrinos exist. They would have left-handed chirality,\nwhereas all known neutrinos are right-handed. All other fermions ex­\nhibit both right-handed and left-handed chirality. If sterile neutrinos\nwere ever discovered, and if they have enough mass and are plentiful\nenough, then they may be the elusive dark matter. However, there has\nnot yet been any detection of sterile neutrinos.\nAnother potential candidate for dark matter that was already at hand\nis the gravitino. Quantum mechanics views the fundamental forces\nas being mediated by a particle and an associated supersymmetry\nparticle. The hypothetical particle that mediates gravity is called the\ngraviton, and its associated particle is called the gravitino. It is pos­\nsible that the gravitino has a large enough mass to account for dark\nmatter. The graviton and the gravitino will be very difficult particles\nto detect.\nMany times, news accounts of these studies report that the scientists\ninvolved failed to detect dark matter. Worded this way, these reports\nare very misleading. Scientists did not fail to detect dark matter in\ngeneral. Rather, the scientists failed to detect particular candidates\nfor dark matter, thus eliminating those candidates from further con­\nsideration. The null results of tests of dark matter candidates are dis­\nproof of particular models of dark matter, not disproof of the exis­\ntence of dark matter. Unfortunately, some comments on these stories\nby some recent creationists fail to reflect this distinction.\nFurthermore, the evidence for dark matter is based upon operational\nscience, the study of how the world operates today. In contrast, in­\nclusion of dark matter into the big bang model and for the origin and\nmaintenance of galactic structure are historical science. Creationists\nought to be aware of this distinction, but alas, many of them don’t\nappear to be.\nThere are relatively few articles in the creation literature support­\nive of dark matter. While not necessarily supportive of dark matter,\nDeYoung (2000) offered a rather neutral evaluation of dark matter.\nWhat is the reason why creationists are so resistant to dark matter?\nAs I have already stated, there appear to be two reasons for this re­\nsistance. One of those reasons is ignorance of the data supporting\ndark matter, thinking that dark matter is a rescuing device. One of the\nmain purposes of this paper is to counter the notion that dark matter\nis a rescuing device. The history of our understanding of dark matter\nas presented here reveals a very different story. Those who think dark\nmatter is a rescuing device seem to have picked up the story of dark\nmatter only after astronomers and cosmologists widely accepted the\nreality of dark matter.\nThe other reason why so many recent creationists doubt the reality of\ndark matter may be the desire not to give up what many creationists\nsee as a good argument for recent origin (at least not over billions\nof years), that, as previously mentioned, galaxy clusters may not be\ngravitationally bound and could be breaking up. If the dispersion ve­\nlocities of galaxies in clusters were the only observations supporting\ndark matter, then this may be a viable possibility. However, how does\none handle the rotation curves of spiral galaxies? One could posit\nthat just like clusters of galaxies, individual galaxies are not stable\nand hence are disrupting as well. Consequently, that might be an ar­\ngument against individual galaxies being billions of years old. But\nthat would only apply to the regions of galaxies outside their nuclei.\nWhy would the nuclear regions of spiral galaxies be subject to bound\norbits while the outer regions of galaxies are not? Simply positing\nthat this is the way the world operates is not a satisfactory answer.\nFurthermore, this tack cannot explain gravitational lensing of distant\ngalaxies by closer clusters of galaxies, so observations of this would\nrequire yet another explanation.\nThere is one additional problem with this explanation. Creationists\nhave long advanced the idea that there is design and stability in the\nworld. For instance, some creationists speak about the stability of\nboth planetary orbits and the orbits of the planets’ natural satellites,\nand even the stability of systems beyond the solar system ( e . g ., Bur­\ngess 2008; Wilson 2003). Which is it? Did God create a stable world,\nor did He create an unstable world? Are creationists willing to sacri­\nfice the stability argument in favor of a lesser argument for relatively\nrecent origin?\nSome creationists have embraced modified Newtonian dynamics\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n5\n",

          "text_content": "(MOND) as an alternate explanation for the observations generally\nattributed to dark matter ( e . g ., Hartnett 2002; Worraker 2002). Pro­\nposed by a non-creationist (Milgrom, M. 1983), MOND hypothesiz­\nes that Newton’s simple inverse square of the distance law of gravity\nis a good description of gravity over relatively short distances (at\nleast on the scale of the solar system), but for distances spanning\nthousands of light years, Newtonian gravity fails to adequately de­\nscribe how gravity operates. Thus, Newtonian gravity must be mod­\nified in such a way that its long-scale behavior is masked over dis­\ntances spanning less than a few thousand light years.\nThis modification comes across as radical, but is it? Newton derived\nhis law of gravity by comparing the measured acceleration of gravity\non the earth’s surface to the centripetal acceleration required for the\nmoon to orbit the earth, and he further tested his hypothesis by show­\ning it accurately described the motions of the planets and the natural\nsatellites of Jupiter and Saturn (Faulkner 2017b). MOND proposes\nto extend Newton’s original approach of fitting orbital motions of\nobjects at distances seven or more orders of magnitude greater than\nthose directly tested in the solar system. In this sense, MOND would\njust be a modification of our understanding of gravity, with New­\ntonian gravity as a special limiting case, much as general relativity\nmodified our understanding of gravity a century ago. So, perhaps\nMOND is not so radical after all. However, since Newtonian gravity\nand general relativity are consistent with one another in the regimes\nunder discussion, MOND would require modification of general rel­\nativity as well. To my knowledge, this has not yet been attempted.\nThere are tests of MOND that we can perform. If MOND correct­\nly describes how gravity operates, then MOND ought to apply to\nall galaxies of sufficient size. However, astronomers have found a\nfew galaxies that have no need of dark matter, that is, spiral galaxies\nwhich have rotation curves that follow Keplerian behavior outside\ntheir nuclei. The first example of this was the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2\n(Faulkner 2018). If MOND properly describes the observed depar­\nture from Keplerian motion outside the nuclei of most spiral galax­\nies, then why does it not apply to galaxies with Keplerian motion\noutside their nuclei? It may seem counterintuitive, but the existence\nof a few large galaxies that have no evidence of dark matter amounts\nto evidence of dark matter in other galaxies.\nAnother test of MOND was presented by the discovery of the inter­\nacting galaxy cluster 1E0657-558, aka the Bullet Cluster (Clowe,\nGonzalez, and Markevitch 2008). This object is two galaxy clusters\nthat appear to have recently undergone a collision. Most of the emit­\nting mass in clusters of galaxies is in the form of hot intergalactic\ngas. Stars are very small compared to the scales of galaxies and clus­\nters of galaxies, so when clusters of galaxies collide, the stars and\ngalaxies largely pass through one another with only modification of\ntheir trajectories. However, the diffuse intergalactic clouds directly\ncollide and stall, leaving the gas originally in the two clusters be­\ntween them. The high-temperature intergalactic gas is detected by\nthe X-rays they emit, while the stars and galaxies are detected by\noptical light. When images of the two are superimposed as in Fig. 4,\nthe intergalactic gas is located between the two galaxy clusters. Since\nthe mass of the intergalactic gas dominates the visible mass, MOND\nwould predict that most of the mass would be aligned with the gas\nand not the visible galaxies. However, dark matter does not appear to\ninteract with normal matter, so the prediction of the mass distribution\nbased upon the assumption of dark matter is that most of the mass\nwould align with the galaxy clusters, not the gas. 1E0657-558 acts as\na gravitational lens of more distant objects, allowing its distribution\nof mass to be mapped. The bulk of the mass is centered on the two\nclusters, not the interposing stalled gas, thus MOND is eliminated as\na possibility. The same sort of observations and reasoning applied to\nthe colliding cluster MACS J0025.4-1222 reach the same conclusion\n(Brada et al. 2008).\nIt’s not as if dark, or yet unseen, matter is a new concept. Neptune\nwas discovered in 1846 based upon calculations of a hypothetical\nplanet responsible for perturbations of the orbit of Uranus. In 1980,\nthe two Voyager spacecrafts discovered that Saturn’s F Ring ap­\npeared braided. The inferred explanation was that there were two\nsmall natural satellites, or moons, nearby that perturbed ring particles\nto produce the braiding. A search for these shepherd moons quickly\nled to the discovery of Prometheus and Pandora. More recent studies\nsuggest that Prometheus plays the dominant role in this process. One\ncan even argue that Wolfgang Pauli’s 1930’s proposal of the neutri­\nno to salvage the conserveation of energy, linear momentum, and\nangular momentum in beta decay was a form of dark matter because\nneutrinos remained undetected until 1956. To be fair, the hypotheti­\ncal planet Vulcan that was proposed in the 19 th century to explain the\nanomaly in the perihelion advance of Mercury’s orbit is an example\nof a failed dark matter prediction. The solution to the problem with\nMercury’s orbit came with the publication of Einstein’s theory of\ngeneral relativity in 1915. Hence, there is precedent for new physics.\nHowever, the question is which of the two, dark matter or new phys­\nics, best explains what we see today. Dark matter is a much better\nexplanation than new physics.\nThere has been at least one refreshing approach for an alternative\nFigure 4. Composite image of 1E0657-558 (the Bullet Cluster). Superim­\nposed over a visible light image of the galaxies is an x-ray image (pink),\nshowing the emission of gas, and the inferred distribution of dark matter\n(blue) from gravitational lensing. The dark matter coincides with the gal­\naxies, not the intergalactic gas, which has greater mass than the galaxies.\nMOND would predict the coincidence of the gas and the need for unseen\nmatter.\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n6\n",

While I may not agree with this proposal, I encourage this sort\nof original thinking.\nIV. DARK ENERGY\nIn a finite universe governed by Newtonian mechanics, gravity\nwill eventually collapse all matter to its center. For centuries, most\nscientists had thought the universe is eternal. But if the universe is\neternal, then collapse should have happened long ago. The fact that\nthis hasn’t happened ought to have convinced astronomers that the\nuniverse is not eternal. But rather than make this straightforward\nconclusion, astronomers instead postulated that the universe also is\ninfinite. In an infinite universe, there is an equal amount of matter in\nall directions whose gravity pulling on matter in all locations so that\nthere is no net motion of matter to bring about a collapse. Therefore,\nthe universe was envisioned as being eternal, infinite, and with no net\nmotion. This static universe prevailed for more than two centuries.\nAlbert Einstein published his theory of general relativity (GR) in\n1915. A year later, Einstein followed up this work by applying GR\nto the universe. However, one of the differences between Newtonian\ngravity and GR is that in a universe governed by GR, the universe\nwill collapse under its own gravity, even if the universe is infinite.\nTo preserve a static universe, Einstein included in his cosmology the\ncosmological constant , usually indicated by the Greek letter λ. The\ncosmological constant acts as a repulsion term that space has for it­\nself. If the value of λ has the right value, then its outward force of\nrepulsion balances the inward force of gravity, producing a universe\nwith no net motion.\nIn 1922, Alexander Friedmann showed that Einstein had failed to\nrealize the general solution of GR applied to the universe. In the gen­\neral case, the universe is either expanding or contracting. By insist­\ning on a static universe, Einstein had settled on the intermediate case\nbetween the two extremes of the general case. Friedmann favored the\nexpanding case, though it is not clear why. It may be that he thought\nexpansion made more sense than contraction in a universe that has\nalways been governed by naturalism. Or it may be that Friedmann\nwas aware of Vesto Slipher’s work commencing in 1912 showing\nthat what eventually were recognized as galaxies had large redshifts,\nconsistent with an expanding universe. The little-known Carl Wil­\nhelm Wirtz (1918) certainly understood the implication of Slipher’s\nwork. Perhaps Friedmann had read Wirtz’s paper. At any rate, cred­\nit for discovery of the expansion of the universe generally goes to\nEdwin Hubble in 1929, though Georges Lemaître had published a\nsimilar thing two years earlier. The difference between the two was\nthat Lemaître’s work was theoretical, based upon Friedmann’s cos­\nmology, while Hubble’s approach was observational.\nThough Einstein originally opposed an expanding universe, he soon\nabandoned the static universe, calling his introduction of λ his great­\nest blunder. However, this assessment is a bit harsh. Einstein had\nthought the universe was static, so he enforced this boundary condi­\ntion on the universe by including λ. Friedmann and Lemaître chose\nboundary values that permitted an expanding universe, with the pre­\nferred value of λ being zero. This cosmology was dominant for about\n70 years, but in the late 1990s astronomers discovered the need to\nreintroduce something akin to the cosmological constant.\nWhat changed? Consider the effect of gravity on the expansion of\nthe universe. The gravity of the matter of the universe tends to slow\nexpansion, which is why Einstein introduced λ to counter this effect\nto preserve a static universe. If the universe is not static, then ex­\npansion will slow, with the amount of slowing in expansion related\nto the density of the universe. Density is an important parameter of\nthe universe, so a good measure of density is important. Assuming a\nconstant speed of light, distance amounts to a lookback time. If the\nexpansion of the universe does not change, then galaxies will demon­\nstrate a strictly linear relationship between their recession and dis­\ntance. However, if expansion has slowed, then very distant galaxies\nwill have greater recession than expected from a linear relationship\nobserved in the local universe, which, assuming lookback time, has\nbeen subjected to slowing. Thus, slowing expansion would show up\nas an upturn in the Hubble relation at great distance. This expected\nbehavior of the Hubble relation has been known for a long time,\nbut limits of accurately measuring the distances of faraway galaxies\nmade testing this impossible. Classical techniques, such as Cepheid\nvariables, were limited to distances of tens of millions of light years,\nbut this effect is not likely to show up except on the scale of several\nbillion light years (for a survey of astronomical distance determina­\ntion methods in the creation literature, see Faulkner [2013]).\nBy the 1970s, astronomers realized that type Ia supernovae provided\nan opportunity to extend distance determination methods to billions\nof light years. This is because type Ia supernovae are very bright (far\nbrighter than other standard candles) and are homogeneous in their\nmaximum brightness. Therefore, if one observes a type Ia superno­\nva at maximum brightness, then one knows its intrinsic brightness,\nand comparison to its observed brightness readily yields its distance.\nType Ia supernovae are relatively easy to distinguish from other su­\npernovae. The problem is that supernovae of all types are relatively\nrare, happening perhaps a few times per century in any given galaxy.\nConsequently, it may be centuries before a type Ia supernova may be\nseen in a galaxy that astronomers regularly monitor. By the 1990s,\nmoderately large robotic telescopes were taking images of hundreds,\nif not thousands, of galaxies every clear night and comparing the\nimages to reference images to search for supernovae. Subtracting a\nreference photo of a galaxy from a newly obtained photo in which\nthere is no supernova yields a blank image. But if a supernova has\noccurred in a galaxy, then subtraction of the reference photo from a\nnew photo will result in an obvious bright spot that computers can\nreadily detect. Once a supernova was detected in a galaxy, alerts\nwere sent to major observatories where astronomers could quickly\nturn very large telescopes to further study the erupting supernova.\nThis process ended up producing many new supernova discoveries\neach year that would have been missed in the past.\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n7\n",

          "text_content": "In the 1990s, two international teams of astronomers formed to make\nuse of this new technique of detecting and observing type Ia super­\nnova to assess the amount of deceleration of the universe. One group\nwas the High-Z Supernovae Search Team, headed by Brian Schmidt\nand Adam Riess. The other group was the Supernova Cosmology\nProject, led by Saul Perlmutter. The two teams hoped to accurately\nfind the distances of enough high redshift galaxies to find the ex­\npected upturn in the Hubble relation and hence measure the amount\nof gravitational deceleration in the universe. To the astonishment of\nboth teams, they discovered that rather than an upturn in the Hubble\nrelation at great distance, there is a downturn. This result was so un­\nexpected that it delayed publication while the two teams attempted to\nfind what they had done wrong. Once they decided that their results\nwere real, the implication was clear – just as an upturn in the Hubble\nrelation would have indicated deceleration of the universe, a down­\nturn in the Hubble relation indicates an acceleration of the universe.\nThe teams published their findings in 1998-1999, and this result was\nso groundbreaking that the three leaders of the teams shared the 2011\nNobel Prize in Physics.\nAfter seven decades, it seemed the cosmological constant was back.\nHowever, rather than being a constant repulsion term in the universe\nas the cosmological constant was, cosmologists today entertain the\npossibility that the repulsion in the universe may change over time.\nHence, cosmologists chose a new term to describe this repulsion,\ndark energy . Why choose those two words? For a long time, cos­\nmologists have used fields to describe various effects in the universe,\nsuch as a field to drive cosmic inflation in the early universe. In phys­\nics, a field is associated with a force (the force is the negative of the\ngradient of the field, thus transforming a scalar field into a vector\nforce). A field represents a potential energy, so when formulated this\nway, the accelerating force of the universe requires energy to drive\nit. The word “dark” was chosen in comparison to dark matter, though\ndark matter and dark energy have nothing in common. The similarity\nof the terms “dark matter” and “dark energy” is most unfortunate be­\ncause it confuses many people who do not understand the difference.\nQuantum field theory (QFT) did not exist in the 1920s when modern\ncosmology took form. QFT offers a physical basis for λ. The cos­\nmological constant appears as the expectation value of the quantum\nfields in their lowest energy state. One manifestation of the so-called\n“zero-point energy” is “vacuum polarization” that drives the Casimir\neffect. The energy in that state is non-zero and the expectation value\nof the fields will appear as a contribution to the stress-energy tensor.\nThe contribution to stress-energy turns out theoretically to be equiva­\nlent to a “cosmological constant” as proposed originally by Einstein,\nbut in this case it is not ad hoc. It is true that the present state of QFT\ndoes not provide a known method for producing a finite value of λ. A\nfinite value can be obtained if a UV cutoff is introduced in momen­\ntum space for the vacuum energy. However, a theoretical basis for\ncomputing the cutoff is unknown at the present. Such cutoffs would\ndepend on new unknown theoretical parameters, which could indi­\ncate new physics yet to be discovered.\nBoth dark matter and dark energy are now incorporated into the stan­\ndard cosmology, indicated as the λCDM model. The λ refers to the\ninclusion of dark energy. The CDM refers to “cold dark matter.” The\nterm cold here does not refer to temperature but rather to the assumed\nspeed of the particles comprising dark matter as compared to the\nspeed of light. Models in which dark matter particles move slowly\nseem to fit other parameters of the big bang model than fast moving\ndark matter particles, hence the exclusion of fast moving (or “hot”)\ndark matter particles in the latest big bang models. As the perceived\nassociation of dark matter with the big bang model accounts for some\nof the opposition many recent creationists have to dark matter, so the\nclose association of dark energy with the current big bang models\nprobably explains why recent creationists generally resist dark ener­\ngy (e.g., Coppedge 2008; Hartnett 2002; Hebert 2012; Sarfati 2018).\nIndeed, as Hill (2017) has shown, the evidence for dark energy, the\ndownturn in the Hubble relation at great distances, has been inter­\npreted entirely within the big bang model and hence, unlike the case\nfor dark matter, the existence of dark energy does rely upon the big\nbang model. However, as Hill also pointed out, even if the big bang\nmodel is incorrect, the evidence from the Hubble relation remains.\nA different cosmology/cosmogony may result in an interpretation\nof that evidence that is different from the interpretation of dark en­\nergy. How might a biblical cosmology/cosmogony reinterpret the\ndownturn in the Hubble relation at great distances? We don’t know,\nbecause no such detailed model exists yet. I encourage recent cre­\nationists to be more guarded in their comments about dark energy,\nmaking a distinction between the conclusion of dark energy and the\ndata upon which that conclusion is based. We need to honestly and\npublicly admit that the downturn in the Hubble relation at great dis­\ntances is real and awaits a different interpretation.\nV. CONCLUSION\nMany recent creationists reject both dark matter and dark energy,\nthough their reasons are not always clear. I perceive that some of the\nmotivation in resisting dark matter and dark energy is an attempt to\nrefute the big bang model. However, as discussed in this paper, this\nis an ill-advised tactic. Much of the criticism of dark matter coming\nfrom recent creationists tends to focus on two fronts:\n1.\t Treating dark matter as a rescuing device for the big bang and\nother evolutionary ideas\n2.\t The negative results of the tests of different theories of the\nidentity of dark matter particles\nHowever, these discussions do not properly handle the facts. There\nare three lines of evidence for dark matter. Two of those three lines of\nevidence preceded dark matter’s inclusion in the big bang model and\nmodern ideas of galactic evolution by many decades. It wasn’t until\nafter astronomers eventually became convinced of the reality of dark\nmatter from the evidence that astronomers and cosmologists began\nto employ dark matter to solve problems with their models. Keep in\nmind that astronomers greatly resisted dark matter for decades – they\nhardly embraced dark matter as a rescuing device. Rather than deny­\ning the existence of dark matter, recent creationists must effectively\nengage with the immense amount of evidence for dark matter.\nSimilarly, recent creationists tend to view dark energy as a rescuing\ndevice for the big bang model. The reality is that within the big bang\nmodel, dark energy is the best interpretation of the downward inflec­\ntion of the Hubble relation at great distance. That is, dark energy is\nbased upon real data that is interpreted in terms of an evolutionary\nmodel. Simply dismissing dark energy out of hand is tantamount to\nFAULKNER Dark matter and dark energy 2023 ICC\n8\n",
